# Data_Analytics

This Analysis task is divided into 3 different `.ipynb` files for easy understanding and better presentation.
1. In the first file, that is, the `Dataset_Creation` file we scrape the data.
2. In the second file, that is, `Dataset_Cleaning` file we clean the scrapped data.
3. In the last file, that is, `Exploratory Analysis` file we analyse the data.

So to understand the complete project, it is recommended to start from the first file and go step by step.
