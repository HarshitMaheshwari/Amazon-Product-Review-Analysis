In this analysis, we first scrape the information of one of the high selling product, that is, Crocs from amazon. The dataset contains the review given by the customer for the Crocs they purchased with its other important details. Later, we use this dataset to answer multiple questions about the product.

#### Remember, this Analysis task is divided into 3 different `.ipynb` files for easy understanding and better presentation.
1. In the first file, that is, the `Dataset_Creation` file we scrape the data.
2. In the second file, that is, `Dataset_Cleaning` file we clean the scrapped data.
3. In the last file, that is, `Exploratory Analysis` file we analyse the data.

So to understand the complete project, it is recommended to start from the first file and go step by step. Rest all the details are mentioned in the markdown cells after every step in the complete process.
