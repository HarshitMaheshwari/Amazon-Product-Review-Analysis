Not the good made in USA ones of years ago
",Outdoor Enthusiast!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have worn Crocs for years, but the well-made ones that came from the USA (Colorado) many years ago.  These made in China ones are a harder plastic and extremely wide so that my feet slip around in them or the shoes fall off.  They also aren't anywhere near as comfortable due to the harder plastic, even if they did fit properly.  I have already started the return process, very disappointed since after many years, my American made ones are finally starting to wear out and need replacing

Two completely different sized shoes marked the same size
",MoMo Wondertoes,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  We have been buying crocs for a long time and this time we received crocs that were marked the right size .... but one was significantly smaller and more narrow than the other. This was something we only realized after leaving on vacation. Our 12 year old constantly complained that the one was too small and the other was too large. He had to wear them until we could find a store to buy him flip flops and so we couldn't return them by the time we got back as they had been worn. Not sure what happened here but I have them and they are definitely two different sizes...

",PJM,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I was hoping these would fit like the Classic Clog Crocs I already have but, they still feel too small.  It's the third pair I've ordered lately and can't seem to find the fit I was hoping for.  Ended up donating these and the others to Value Village since I had worn them a couple of times.  None of them seemed as roomy as the ones I have almost worn out.  I love Crocs but am frustrated trying to find the right fit!

crocs Unisex Classic Clog,Black,5 M US Men's / 7 M US Women's

  . I have worn a pair of Crocs clogs for over 10 years and decided it was time to replace them. The clogs now are nothing like the clogs of years ago. And sad to say the quality of what was a great buy is gone. This clog is now a plastic of some sort and the insole is not any more comfortable than a regular pair of shoes. I normally wear 6.5US and got a size 7. They are tight across the foot when using the strap, my foot is pushed forward and is uncomfortable. But without the strap the clog doesn't seem to fit right. Sorry to say I will not be buying Crocs clogs anymore.

",Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I bought these to replace an earlier pair which were just great, and which I wore for two years.  These were the exact same size and style as before (different colour only).I received these on October 4th, 2018.  Photo taken November 2nd, 2018.  That is less than a month.  You can draw your own conclusions from a glance at the photo.Also, this pair seemed smaller/tighter than the original pair, despite supposedly being the exact same size.  And the rivet/pivot on the strap raised a nasty blister on my foot.Will have to give serious thought before buying another pair of these!

Not a good Croc
",Kathleen Stewart,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are a cheap Crocs.  They have no arch support like the better Crocs do, the rubber is hard and not flexible and soft like other Crocs.  And they are much too large for a womens B width foot.  In fact, these Crocs actually hurt my feet and legs when I wore them out.  I will never wear these Crocs again.  In fact, I am taking them to Goodwill today and I just got them!I have 2 pairs of older Crocs that cured my Achilles tendinitis and plantar facshitis (spelling sorry), that mold to my feet and are so soft and cushiony and non slip.I think alot of what's wrong with these Crocs is the unisex thing.  I wouldn't buy them if I were you, you'll be sorry.

  Crocs has apparently decided to save money on materials by shrinking the shoes. These are a full 1/2 inch shorter and 3/8 inch narrower than the same size ones they were intended to replace. I have returned them. I'm hesitant to order a larger size as they are also narrower, so I guess after 15 years of wearing them, I will have to find another shoe.

  DO NOT buy these crocs if you are looking for the real deal, they are huge and the holes are the wrong size/ in the wrong places. They look fine on their own, but compared with real ones they are obviously fake. Spend the extra 5-10 dollars on real ones from the store or Crocs website.

",Judith E. Oakland,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I wish I had believed the comments about various size differences according to country of manufacture.  The Crocs I've always purchased in the past ran at least a size too large and very wide.  So, I ordered a size smaller than I usually wear; but the Croc slip-on I received is like a woman's size 8 regular (and I wear and 11 wide).  I can't even get my foot into it.  I guess I'll have to branch out to another brand of footwear that's more reliable.  I hate returning things and I usually just take the loss, but these are going back.

Uncomfortable
",Janet Mustain,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I got these because I wanted something that could get wet, without needing to dry forever like tennis shoes, for when I have to take the dogs for their morning walk, and still protect my toes and provide some arch support. I should never have bought them.First, if you have wide feet, just don't bother.  I ordered the Men's 9, because I wear an 11 Wide in Women's shoes.  HA!  These were barely long enough and tighter than any other man's shoe I've ever tried on before.  I wear men's tennis shoes because I have wide feet, but these shoes are very narrow for men's shoes.Second, your feet will sweat in these like crazy.  If you thought your feet sweat in your workout shoes, just wait till you wear these for a few minutes in the heat.  I have feet that sweat, not as bad as some people I know, but still, I like a shoe that breathes.Third, the little nubs that are supposed to keep your feet from slipping are very hard and unpleasant on the bottom of your feet and, even though this shoe runs small, your foot will slip around once it starts to sweat or gets wet.These are now shower shoes only, and that is a lot of money to spend on something you can only wear to take a shower.

Uncaring company!
",Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I am very upset! I spent $45.00 purchasing these to wear a month!??!! The first time I cleaned them in hot, soapy water.....by morning when I put them on my feet, the left one had shrunk CONSIDERABLY. The right one only a little. Regardless, I cannot wear them now. The left foot is too short and it squeezes my foot as it became very narrow and snug!So be careful cleaning them. You may have regrets like myself! What a waste of my money!!!**ordered a second time because I loved the heel cushioning these offered up until the left foot shrunk. We shall see how the second pair work out. So far, so good but I haven't attempted to clean them either.  I will update after I do. I have to say I am absolutely DISGUSTED I have not heard from the seller! So even if this second pair works out, I will never give them more than one star. That is extremely poor customer relations. Obviously once they have your money, they could care less if you have an issue with your shoes.

  I have one pair of Crocs, ordered from Amazon in 2008.  This year, they got full of paint due to painting our house.  There still is nothing wrong with them other than the paint.  So, I decided to treat myself to a new pair.  The new ones are stiff, the nubs on the inside hurt and the toe box really wants to yank off my baby toenail, even though I trim them weekly.  Returning.  Way to screw up a great product, Crocs.  I soaked my old ones in soap and water overnight, dried them in the sun, stuffed newspaper inside and gave them 2 coats of Rustoleum flat black spray paint.  Viola!  Like new.  I am now a former Crocs customer.  The old ones fit like a glove and are the most comfy shoes I own.

Sizing Inconsistencies (maybe based on region of manufacture)
",Frank,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  This was my first pair of Crocs. I'm a men's size 8 in almost all brands of sneakers, so ordered my normal size. When these arrived, they were massive. My feet were swimming in them, and I could rattle them around by shaking my feet, heel straps engaged. But, I read that Crocs are supposed to be very loose, and just rolled with it. They never felt right, and so I decided to stop by a local Crocs store to make sure. The Crocs at the retail store in the same size/model were completely different. Since I had them both, I was able to compare and the Amazon ones felt and looked more like a size 9 or 10. I thought maybe they were fakes, but they were sold directly by Amazon and looked legit. The only difference I could tell was the retail store ones were made in Vietnam, whereas the Amazon ones were Brazil. So maybe they have very different injection molds at each location that cause for the size inconsistencies. Luckily, Amazon allowed me to return them and I bought a properly fitting size 8 pair of Crocs, made in Vietnam.

  Sigh, I expected to love these. My boys are so obsessed with their crocs that they practically live in them. My mother also insists they are the only shoe comfortable enough for all day wear for working on her feet all day. However, I immediately noticed how big they look. I slipped them on, hoping they would look less large, but no, they looked like little boats for my feet. I figured this would be ok, mostly wearing these for stream play, but they are constantly filling with sand and little pebbles. So of course, that is not a great quality in shoes dedicated to stream play. However, when I was brave enough to wear these ridiculous slippers out in public, the squeaked with every single step. Given their high price tag, I‚Äôm pretty disappointed.

  I have purchased several pairs of crocs in the past, and this pair was supposed to be exactly identical to a pair I had previously purchased on Amazon. I actually clicked ""Buy it again"" on that previous order.These are not the same shoes.

  I have loved Crocs & have bought countless pairs. This pair was defective. The back strap was clearly a size larger than the shoe itself.

Hideous Cheesy Feet
",Teacher/Business Owner,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I got these because someone recommended them for wearing around the house on our hard tile floors. We take off our outdoor shoes inside our home. Anyhow, they are the ugliest pair of shoes I have ever owned. They also make my feet look huge and wide. But that is ok since I got them to wear inside and not many people will see me in them. However, there is another problem. In spite of the holes, they get very hot and are not breathable. If you wear them without socks, your feet will get stinky sweaty. Lastly the arch support is ok, not as good as Birkenstock. The only good thing is they are soft and cushiony which I need walking around in hard tile. But other than that, I think they are no good and don‚Äôt understand the popularity. To me they are just overpriced made in china foam shoes. Nothing great. I wish I got a pair of EVA birkenstocks to wear around the house instead. Eva Birks are not as ugly, and have better arch support and nice cushion. Also price wise I think they are about the same. My Husband got the Birkenstock‚Äôs and I like his way way better. Also birks are made in Germany (not China like crocs) and they are better quality as a result.

Fatal Flaw - ‚ÄúMade In Mexico‚Äù - Raised Heel Strap Printing
",zride96,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have been buying Crocs for my son since he was old enough to walk. He‚Äôs always found them comfortable and we have gone through many pairs over the years. Now we just bought a new pair and they fit great with ONE BIG EXCEPTION. They are now ‚ÄúMade in Mexico‚Äù and they used raised printed lettering on the inside of the heel strap that is very uncomfortable. When my son pointed this out and how uncomfortable it would be I thought he was kidding. Sure enough I ran my fingers over it and yeah it would be very uncomfortable. Luckily I had his previous pair and was able to remove the heel strap, without any printing, and replace it on the new pair. Most people may not have this option so I would caution against buying these as I know it would rub against the skin and be very uncomfortable. Bad decision from the manufacturer! I hope this can be corrected ASAP. They almost were returned because of one seriously fatal flaw from the manufacturer.

Immediately after trying them on got a needle-like sharp pain in my toe and a black and blue swollen spot. (I didn't see the Recluse spider as they are very shy and inconspicuous and quickly disappear. (I have had these bites before and know what they are like). The pain kept coming back. Luckily I had a homeopathic salve and pills on hand. After applying the salve twice and taking the pills twice and sticking my foot in a cold compress, the pain subsided.The next day my toe is still swollen and a little sore...  Thanks for the envenomation, Amazon.Re the shoes: Love the color and ease of wearing. Love that it's waterproof. Got stuck in a rainstorm today - no problem. The only problem was the seller/packaging. I will only say this. Buy from a different vendor.

  The cut of these crocs is different than my older ones. It is very tight around the instep and cut is different on the heel. The material is much stiffer than my other crocs. Debating whether to order a larger size, or try to break them in. But the whole point of crocs is that they are roomy and require no break in time. What is going on with crocs now? Why are they shaped differently? I loved crocs and have a lot of foot issues so would like to find a solution.

  Can't believe more people aren't complaining about the little bumps all over the sole of these shoes that stab me whenever I stand up, even when wearing socks. I'm a big guy, so maybe being heavier puts more pressure on my feet. But I'm probably gonna return these because I feel like I'm stepping on tiny rocks. Ok maybe not that bad, but it's not the comfort I'm looking for. Also, I have wide feet (4E) and usually buy a half size up when wides aren't available.

  I never have liked the looks of these butt ugly things but my podiatrist told me to get a pair because of a foot problem.  They do offer great support and curiousness for my poor broken foot.  I find that when I walk my heel tends to extend over the inner sides and wants to roll in.  This is because I have such a high instep that my foot does not go all the way in.  I have about an inch of room in front of my big toe and my heel actually sticks out the back a little.  Perhaps I should have gone with a larger size?  The construction of these shoes is great and they are comfortable.  I expect that I will continue to wear these around the house once my foot has healed because of the support they offer.  I like them as slippers but not for walking any distance.

Not like my old Crocs
",Tripping Wisteria,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I bought my first pair of Crocs almost ten years ago, back when they were made in Colorado.  They were the most comfortable shoe for hanging around the house or cooking in the kitchen for long periods of time.  My house has tile or hardwood so there isn't a lot of give there.  Those Crocs were made out of a softer, squishier rubber that had a lot of give to it.  These Crocs are made of a firmer material that seems like it has some plastic in it.  They aren't very cushioned.  They are also a lot smaller.  They fit but just barely.  Don't know if that's because I got a pair from Mexico instead of China (and how weird is it to be hoping you get one of the ones from China but all the reviews agree they fit better than the ones from Mexico.)  Also these have anti-fatigue nubs inside.  They are arranged in ridges, higher in some parts than others.  You can see it's meant to be higher above the ball of your foot, under your toes but the weird sizing keeps my foot from fitting perfectly in that area so mostly I'm just walking on uneven nubs.  I don't know if they work for anti-fatigue because they hurt my feet and I can only wear these shoes for about an hour at a time.  I suppose it will be like when I was a kid in the summer and at first it hurt to go barefoot outside but after a while your feet toughen up and it stops hurting.  Not thrilled though to have paid money for shoes that my feet have to toughen up for.  They are also a lot hotter to wear than my old Crocs.  Not sure if it's because of the smaller size or the new material.  Overall, I'm very unhappy with these shoes.  Looks like I'll have to find a replacement for my old Crocs elsewhere.

They Work for What I Need, But They Seem Highly Overrated

  I bought these specifically for my rowing club needs. I needed something waterproof, easy to get on & off quickly, and the ability to stuff my foot into while wearing bulky wool socks (and, as I encountered the other day, the ability to actually float). They do provide for all of these needs. The fit, however, is a little weird. I'm a pretty solid Women's 7, with a fairly wide foot. The width is fine, but my toes hit the end of the shoe pretty aggressively without socks, and the toe grip thingy on the sole seems oddly placed.That said, I can see why some people think they're comfortable. But here are my top cons:They are terrible for gardening. If I'm walking on wet grass in the morning, my feet get wet. If I'm doing even light weeding, I get dirt stuck everywhere between the shoes and my feet.They are plastic and no matter how many holes you put in them, my feet sweat like crazy.They seem kind of expensive for plastic shoes.I think I'm going to stick to my FitFlops for life outside of rowing a boat.

Bought my first Crocs at a yardsale and they're wearing out so I ordered these which I believed to be the same thing, but they're absolutely not.  The bottoms of my old ones say ""W10-11  M8-9"".  These are ""M9 W11"" and the shoe is so big my foot is just rattling around in there.  They're going back, but I honestly don't know what size to order now.  My advice is to never buy shoes or hats on-line without free returns, and even then don't do it.

  I bought this for my daughter in her usual size for Christmas and it was WAY too big!

If she wasn't so excited about getting them (Her swim team wears them on the pool deck) I wouldn't buy her the new pair. I wish they offered an even exchange or explained that they didn't. Good product but bummed about being out an extra $16.

the mystery of Crocs
",Cristina,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I try these because I needed  garden shoes and since the black in my size was on sale I wanted to try for myself if they are really all that different of the cheaper copies.Well they are lighter than many I tried, but I got a pair when in Italy, brand named ""Woz!"" they are made of identical stuff.The list price on Croc side is $35 for these, I pay quite a bit  less here but I wonder how can some vendor ask close or more than 100 bucks for rubber shoes...This are garden clogs... maybe the brand has a kind of placebo effect or maybe my feet are not attuned to the different quality of rubber...One good thing, this design with the back strap, would make a better choice versus slides to use in the shower for an older person.

  This is the third pair of Crocs I have owned and I really like the fit and comfort and the protection over the toes but the previous two pair both shrunk several sizes when left out in the sun.  So much so that they were unwearable and had to be thrown away.  People have said they could be stretched out again with heat and water but I had no luck.

Issue with Amazon, moreso than the product
",Nick,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  The Crocs are shipped by Amazon in a bag. Because of this, anything on top of them are going to compress the shape. Clearly mine had been squished for quite some time, as the shape of the shoe opening is drastically creased. Stupidly, I figured this would reform over time... Instead I get blisters every time I wear them, so they're going to be donated. I'm a big fan of Crocs (mostly for the sex appeal), but I would never get them through Amazon again.IMPORTANT ALSO - The actual material itself feels much cheaper than the other crocs I own and purchased direct. Perhaps they are making an ""amazon"" version to keep up with demand? I'd highly recommend finding them elsewhere.

  In the ""how does this product fit?"" drop-down list, ""too narrow"" and ""not wide enough"" are not choices. CROCS come in MEDIUM. No AA, B, C, D, DD etc.I realize it is not a serious shoe like a Florsheim, a Rockport or a New Balance. But how about an a B, C and D at least.I loved CROCS till I got these. I have 2 pair that are at least five years old and half hundreds of thousands of miles on them---no tread so they are scary on wet roads, but still serviceable. Both pair are substantially wider than the new ones so I know CROCS weren't always just Medium. Just like I know that people are not all Medium. And that's really the issue in making a product.The CROC website says there are different widths: ""Roomy"", ""Relaxed"", and ""Standard."" You just can't get them. Amazon and Zappos and all other outlets have Medium. Which is a ""CROC.""

  This was my second attempt at getting a new pair of Crocs that fit. My shoe size is W6.5 so I bought the size W6 Crocs. When they arrived and I tried them on, they were too small. My toes were scrunched together and walking just a few steps was not comfortable at all. I returned them and ordered the next size up (W7), but they were still too small. I compared them next to the pair I currently have (size W6-7/S/M4-5, bought from a shop in Mexico) and you can immediately see the size difference (see attached photo). Haven't decided yet whether to go up the next 2 sizes or just go up 1 size at a time. I am able to return them for a full refund, so that's good. But seeing how much smaller they are, I might jump up to size 9 even though my shoe size has never been that big. If those fit me well, then I will change my rating to 5 stars, as I love my Crocs and wanted to replace them with ones I could wear outside (wore a hole through them that they are now inside shoes/slippers).

  I have worn crocs for years, never a problem. I ordered these and they came in and had the right size stamped on them so I tossed them into the closet since my old crocs were still hanging in there. Pulled them out yesterday and both shoes are too small despite the correct size (13) stamped on the bottom.  The left shoe is even smaller than the right one.  What a waste of time and money. I should have tried them on back then but with the correct size stamped on them it did not even occur to me. I have long ago tossed out the box. A waste of time and money. If you buy from this place then make sure you test out everything. Crocs are a very loose fitting casual shoe and I have never had one not fit. But live and learn.

  The baby blue color was pretty. I bought it in size 9B (W)/ 7 B(M). My daughter wears a size 7.5-8.0, and I am a size 8.5-9.0. The shoe was too long by a thumb and a quarter length for me and even longer for my daughter. I based the purchase on an older croc that was labeled 8-9 and which fit her just fine but touched my toe. I tend to like to purchase a half size up, so I ordered the 9. Because the length was too long, the ankle strap was useless. The width was too wide for my medium width feet and extra wide for my daughter's narrow feet. If you are a size 8.5-9.0 like me, I'd order a size 8. But beware that the width will still be big in general and especially for folks with narrow feet. The little nubs in the shoe were more pronounced in the toe area and hardly felt in the other areas of the shoe. I have flat feet, and the shoe did not have any arch support which works fine for me since my feet tend to hurt when shoes have significant arch support.

I'm disappointed that they don't fit like they used to. (My old pair, a Women's 7, that I have to throw out was much more comfortable.)  The way the straps are attached, they don't go all the way to the back of the shoe, so you are losing almost 3/4 of an inch.  If you use them like a clog, they fit okay.

  These are great shoes but if you order a men's size 11 what you get says size 11 but in reality it is really a size 10 so If I were you order the next size bigger, it will feel and fit better. I can wear the size 11 but without socks, not with socks too tight. It's time that shoe manufactures set a size standard on all shoes.

Returned first pair - Second Pair a little tight for a wide foot

  The first pair had the heel loop come off. The plastic part which secures the loop to the shoe came off. Luckily this was after just 5 minutes. Check this part first before wearing it outside. Other than that the second pair arrived and seems to work well. This are my first Crocs so we will see how much I like them as time goes by. Note - I usually wear a Wide shoe and the 11 M seem a bit tight when I wear socks. The similar Crocs offered on the Crocs website say that they are roomy, but I beg to differ and these same shoes don't seem to be.You might try a larger size if you have a wide foot. Note - if I don't wear socks the Crocs are fine - so I guess it depends on how you are going to wear these. If you plan to wear them with socks, get a larger size. On the beach, these would be perfect for me.

  Not sure what exactly happened, but I'll try to describe it. Sorry if it would sound weird :)So, first of all ‚àí I ordered Khaki, but received Black color. I actually didn't mind, because black was very good-looking, not dark-grayish, but really black, so I liked it.As for the size, here's where weirdness starts. I initially was happy with the size, it was even a tiny little bit larger than I wanted, but it's good with this type of footwear. Later I felt like it became fit exactly right, so I figured I just ""got used to it"". Then, after some time (I was happily wearing them for couple weeks, and really enjoyed them), I once found that I literally can't put them on: they are too small. I thought they just deformed a bit because of whatever -- salty ocean water, sun etc., and that they'll get back to normal soon. My wife half-jokingly said that my feet swelled :)Anyway, I tried to wear them for a minute, and it really hurt (I know, I shouldn't have, that was stupid, why would they become large again :)).Anyway, now they are even smaller, I can't even pretend I can put them on. I swear all my other shoes are fine, so my feet didn't swell :)I don't know if this all makes any sense, so I'm putting three stars as a neutral rating.

A little tight
",D & K,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Our family loves crocs and we have many pairs.  I assumed all crocs are made the same but for some reason these feel smaller and tighter than our other pairs.  Not sure if it is just an off thing or not.  Hopefully they will stretch.

Size Not Consistent with Previous Same Model
",John S.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I had an old pair of Crocs that were the same supposed size as the new pair I ordered (men's size 12). I have a wide foot and the old pair fit extremely well. This new pair (also men's size 12) are significantly smaller and narrower and barely fit my foot. I put the old pair up next to the new pair and confirmed that the new pair is, indeed, smaller and narrower.It's too bad that Crocs chose to change their sizing without letting their customers know. I'm not pleased with this purchase or with the company.

The bottoms were very smooth and comfortable, but for some reason one of the straps ...
",Welton E. Underwood,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have a pair of Crocs I bought at Dicks and wore them to and around Maui, Hawaii.  The bottoms were very smooth and comfortable, but for some reason one of the straps tore and came off so I ordered the pair I'm now wearing from Amazon and they are extremely uncomfortable with nibs so long on the insoles that they hurt and make my feet ache.  Being a diabetic I can't risk the crocs causing problem.  I wondered about the crocs so I took them to an actual croc store in Myrtle Beach and the sales lady assured me they were authentic saying that it depends on what country the crocs are made in as to how the nibs are on the insoles.  She suggested sanding off the nibs with sandpaper saying that is what her Dad did,  The Croc employee was so nice, helpful, and sweet especially when I fell in the store.  She only had one problem:  her name wasn't Amazon.  I wish I had sent the shoes back but for a swap-out but I didn't.  I hoped the nibs would wear down.  They haven't.  In researching this particular order, I discovered the straps on the new crocs are removable, so I am going to look at removing them and placing them on my original pair of crocs.  Croc Corporate is trying to help me and they have been extremely nice just like the Amazon employees with whom I have dealt.  I  guess I am just a balding, fat, Southern old coot who is too set in his ways about what he likes or doesn't.  I look at my wife of 35 years and then at Amazon.  If I was told I had to make a choice between the two, well I just I hope Amazon will be real understanding when I park my motorhome in their parking lot.  Love the place.

Hard, uncomfortable, small.
",Taylor Hastings,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Okay, I just got my first real pair of crocs.  I've been wearing knock-offs for years and have been trying to find more of that brand, but to no avail, so I went with the crocs.  They are rock hard and the soles have little tiny spikes that are not so pleasant!  I wear size 7 1/2, but decided I wanted them a little roomy, so I went with size 8-9 and was surprised that my feet barely fit in them.  I'm dearly hoping they break in because they are really hard and tight on the top.  At least they are super wide (and I have REALLY wide feet, so that's saying a lot!).  Just had to put in my two cents.

  There's something about these Crocs that are just different than the pair I had a few years ago. It might be the little knobs in the footbed or something, but they're just not as comfortable out of the package like my first pair. Plus, they're just slightly more narrow. Not so much that it's a problem, and they do give more with time, but it's noticeable. At least to me. I'd probably give this more like 3.5/5 than a 3.

",Public buyer.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  It seems that the size and toe space is different depending on where the Crocs were produced. The ones from Mexico seem to run smaller with a narrower toe space than the ones from China. This makes it difficult to order because it is not clear as to where the product being sent to me is from, Why should there be a difference in size for the ""same"" shoe? Are the templates used different in different countries. It may need to be stated in the order guide where the product being sent is from, or it would be best if the buyer of the product can choose the manufacturer of the Croc. All of this is moot if there is still a difference in fit between the same products from the same country much less from Mexico vs China. That's why it is so confusing when I read the critiques of the product where some one would say the size is 1/2 to 1 size larger than stated and someone else says it is 1 to 1/2 size too small. The comparison must also state whether they were discussing a Croc produced in China vs Mexico or where ever.

  The sizing on Crocs seems rather variable. Makes it hard to shop them.Also, I once read an article that many cheap shoes and not so cheap shoes are being manufactured with toxic plastics. The key to knowing if they are toxic is a sweet odor emanating from the product. Sadly, this pair had a pungent sweet smell.

Beware of ladies' vs. Unisex sizing!
",Sharon M.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Based on a previously purchased pair similar (but without backstrap) that were a bit snug at the end of the day or on ""swollen feet"" days, I purchased this, only one size larger. Mistake.  I am SWIMMING in these. I might try them in the fall with socks, but that defeats the purpose of easy rinse off with hose through the holes.  Moreover, since most gardening is done with water, I'll be left with wet, dirty socks each time.  Beware of the difference between ladies', men's, and unisex products.  My former purchase must have been a ladies' shoe (didn't buy online, and there's no indication inside or underneath shoe, just a size number), and these are unisex.  Bottomline, if basing new purchase size on a current pair of shoes, know that unisex is like TWO sizes larger than a current ladies' size.  It would be nice, also, if Crocs would 1.) consider labeling the bottom of their shoes with an L, U, or MN (not just M, or people might think ""medium"" who didn't know better) before the size number (for ladies, uni, or men) so that  future customers (and current! esp. if received as a gift) know what they own, and equally important, 2.) state how to convert various gender sizing with ordering similar or same shoes--example ""Order same size if you want a slightly larger fit, when going from ladies' to unisex.""

inferior product

  I read a lot of reviews here before purchasing the crocs. My boyfriend has crocs that I slip on and we both love them so had better get my own! His are comfortable and made in china. Many reviews said the mexican manufactured croc offered less cush, uneven heel straps, and pretend nubs on the footbed. Reviews compared this shoe to the chinese manufactured croc, which was more cushion-y, had even heel straps, and nice nubs on the footbed.Amazon claimed their crocs were Origin: China ( I cut and pasted the last two words from the description of the product in ""my orders"" section of their website.) I was disappointed when the crocs arrived. The heel straps were even with each other, but at least a half inch shorter than the shoe. The aren't cushion-y at all. The footbed nubs are more like a design. They aren't comfortable, at all, and the heel strap is unusable because it makes the shoe much too small.I wouldn't have bought the shoe knowing it would be from mexico, given the reviews. Apparently they have free returns on some products but it is hard to find if this shoe is one of them. If its not the return cost is half the price of the shoe, so I'm stuck with a mislabeled inferior product.And they aren't even comfortable! So what's the point?In addition, there was trouble with the shipping of this product and two others I ordered at the same time. I've been wasting my time on the phone with generally unhelpful amazon reps for the last three days. The man I spoke with today was extremely helpful, and when I mentioned this to him, he said on the fourth call Amazon directs the caller to a Senior Agent, (aka someone who is helpful) but the calls prior will be directed to someone who is not a senior agent (aka someone who is not helpful). I am always curious to know the whereabouts of the call center, and I feel intrusive asking, but I did ask this time, and the man was in Costa Rica. I'm pretty sure the guy I spoke with yesterday was in India, and I would love to know how many american cents amazon pays him a week. He could be helpful, but he has a lot of ""Amazon policies"" to stick to which prevented us from getting anywhere.Amazon has lost my favor. We had a good run, though.

  My first pair of Crocks and it will probably be my last.  Wider than most medium sized shoes. Length is ok.  Don't stay on very well without the heel strap which is not adjustable.  Overpriced for what you are getting.

Sizing is an issue
",Chloe Pham,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I love these shoes they are very comfortable but the sizes frustrate me. If you are a half size, sizing down will allow the shoe to only fit without the back strap on and if you size up the shoe will fit only with the back strap on.

Don't ever buy unisex Crocs for myself
",Cynthia,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These unisex shoes don't fit, and I've been trying forever to get a label to send them. I can't because I made a mistake with the white ones(too big) and spent forever trying to get the correct mail label for the black Crocs. What must I say or do to get the RIGHT LABEL? I live 50 miles from the UPS Store. It's not in Washington,NC as your employees INSIST that it is. There's a Mailbox store without the capabilities to aid Amazon's technological way of accepting returns.

Imported just not the same...
",misselaines25,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I'm so disappointed with Crocs - these I got are made in Mexico, and they're so different from my favorites, which were made in Colorado. Those were (and still are, after many years) soft and comfortable. Because of the reviews, I ordered up a size, and they're HUGE. Because I'd thrown away the wrapping, I won't return them, and I might order a smaller size, just to see. But they're hard and shiny - not at all what I want...at least the back straps seem to be the same length, unlike others that were reviewed. I ordered online because the stores are full of other styles that also just don't fit the same. Very frustrating...

  I am so disappointed right now. I bought this as a gift for my gramps. So he was so excited when he received the item, used it right away, and then suddenly when we checked the size, it turned out that the other one was bigger (size 11, he's size 10). I know that I can send this back and ask for refund/replacement. But the thing is, my gramps didn't want to do it because it'll take time for us to get the item again. Now, even if I want to send it back, I have no choice but to just let him use a pair of crocks with a different size.

",Lee Trafford,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  There is no longer any uniformity in Crocs Classics.  I have several pairs of Crocs Classics in size 11W/9M which fit fine.  I recently ordered two additional pairs in the same size, and they are markedly smaller - close to a full size smaller - though they are marked as 11W/9M.  All pairs were made in Mexico, so it is not like different molds in different countries.  There is simply no consistency, and my tendency now would be to NOT buy Crocs online from Amazon or any other retailer but to buy them in a store where I can try them on before buying.  Very disappointed in Crocs as a company for not maintaining uniformity in molds for a shoe that has been around for many years.

Shrinking crocs
",E. J. Dutton,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Until a couple of weeks ago, I would have given these shoes 4 or 5 stars. However, I found out that if you leave them out in the sun (on a deck, for example), they *shrink*! I can't wear the pair I bought in December, as they no longer fit on my feet. I bought another pair earlier, and loved them. The tread on the bottom had worn down after a couple of years of hard use, so I replaced them with the exact same item. I will still replace this pair with the same thing again, but I certainly will not leave them on the deck when I bring my dogs back in the house..

Great shoes...when you get the fit that you ordered!
",Firefly,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I was disappointed in the fit. actually too wide and a little short. I ordered my usual shoe size. Out of three different Croc shoes that I have purchased recently, this was the worst fit. It would help a lot if when ordering, there was more to go on to select a proper fit. Then there is the chance that you did not get the same manufactured shoe as was described. From reading other comments, I feel that my experience in buying  Croc shoe is very similar. Thus my three stars. I love a Croc, when it fits as described. I feel that I will no longer participate in this Croc hunting game in the future. I, unfortunately, do not live near any Croc shoe stores.

The Mysterious Sizing of Crocs
",Casey Y.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Purchased the silver Croc and fell in love with them (did not see that coming!).  Sprained my ankle pretty badly a few days later and fortunately had these which were the only shoe I could wear with all the tape and the ankle brace. (Felt fairly stable, too!) Decided to buy some more, so got the khaki. Weirdly tho, the khaki are the same size (per the chart, 10""=9 women)...BUT, the size label on the new package had ""roomy"" on the size label and the Croc is way larger than the same-sized silver purchased before and had fit just dandy. As I pointed out to Amazon, the ""roomy"" designation's explanation was nowhere to be found in the description on the web page. Of course (and I may yet do exactly this), I can keep ordering them and hoping I will get a non-""roomy"" shoe.  But, it does seem a whole lot messier (more work and time) than the seller being clear about the sizes or at least noting that some of the sizes come ""roomy"".  Why was there no description on ANY of the Croc shoes I looked at (studied the size chart on every Croc I looked at, so that wasn't the problem) delineating the ""roomy"" sizing.  It just seems to be common sense.  I know nothing else sized this way and am glad for that.  Imagine a dress or pants that come in a size 9 and a size 9 roomy, but you can't know by the description...  I mean, even then there's designations like ""relaxed fit"" so you are aware of the difference.

no longer Made in USA - Made in China!
",T. E. Mo,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  The cayman i received fits fine and works fine.  The details of the moldings, however, were noticeably less defined than the ones i bought last year.  Upon closer examination, i noticed that the words MADE IN USA imprinted on the underside of the crocs on last year's model were replaced with MADE IN CHINA on this year's model.  Perhaps THAT explains the lacking quality difference?  Again it still works fine, but SORRY!  I'm not paying $30 for crocs MADE IN CHINA that look like the cheaper chinese-made knock-offs!  For those, the only things lacking are the cute little croc buttons on the sides.  I'll buy other brands (albeit made in china) for a lot less.

(It was worth a try)  I was excited to find this size 14 on Amazon.  Upon receiving the Crocs I found that they were marked as 14, but were several sizes too big.  I could have left my shoes on and put them inside the Croc.  When I used the printed the return label through Amazon I found that I had to pay the shipping to return them.  I contacted the seller, Surf and Dirt.com, and talked to a helpful customer service rep.  He told me that I would have to ship the item back at my cost and then after examination they would make a determination of whether they would pay shipping.To follow up:  I returned the sandals which were inspected by Surf and Dirt and my money was promptly refunded for the item and delivery.  For customer service I would give a 5.  Unfortunatly the product was way off the mark.

  Inconsistent sizing, at least on those made in Mexico. We were looking for next size up to replace previous pair for a fast-growing teen. The size W9/M7 is identical to W8/M6, both made in Mexico, with the strap being shorter than before. Inconsistent sizing makes it virtually impossible to buy online. This model is called Classic and is supposed to substitute for Cayman, but the sizing is all wrong. The ones made in China seem to run larger, but you do not know the origin of the pair that will be shipped.The actual Crocs store might be currently the best option for proper sizing, unfortunately.

This is the first time I have written a review and the only time I have not been happy with an Amazon product and I make a lot of purchases on Amazon.  Stuffing the inside of the Crock to keep its shape would have made a difference.

I needed a size, 11 men! unfortunately, the product comes from overseas so to return it it would have cost me more than 2x the original price!

Order smaller than your actual shoe size!
",Jacob Beaumont,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Ordered these just as a little joke, but I have worn them multiple times because they are very comfy. Unfortunately the sizes either run big, or I just ordered wrong. I ordered a size 10 and they are very, very big on me but the strap on the back does help hold them on pretty well which is the only reason i did not return them and exchange them with a different size. If you want to order these and are not sure what size to get, an example of my shoe sizes might help. I wear a mens 9 in converse, mens 9.5 in adidas, and mens 10 in vans. Hopefully that helps you understand what size to purchase.

  Unfortunately these don't fit my feet and I'll be returning them. I think the problem is that they are a Unisex style which may be wider than a normal ladies medium would be. Also, when trying to use the strap to keep them on my feet, my toes were shoved into the toe of the shoe which was painful when trying to walk.Other friends and family members love their Crocs, I'm just the unlucky one.

The pair I just received are at least two sizes too big, despite being the 'correct' size I've ordered previously.  They also feel completely different.  Where all of my previous Crocs feel like rubber/foam, these feel like slippery plastic.These also appear to have been made in Mexico, whereas my other pairs have Made in Italy on the bottom.  Perhaps that's the difference, they are clearly different and that's unfortunate.

I'm wearing them for yard work, as I did my old pair, but not sure if that's a great idea, given that they are a little small.

The pair I got, the heel on the shoe is misshapen/deformed and the support band is quite a bit shorter/tighter on that same shoe, making it a bit uncomfortable. The other pair I purchased was not bagged or on a hanger and had scuffs all over, possibly a return.

",Matthew W Shepherd,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Well, I wear a men's 7.5, so I ordered an 8 because of how large the fit is, as per reviews. My foot slides around in them when I walk. I couldn't imagine wearing them working in the garden. Way too big. Why can't crocs just come in the proper size like other shoes?

Satisfied, not ecstatic, but I'll continue to buy/wear out of loyalty.
",Andrew,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I started wearing Crocs when I began college in Boulder, CO, which is the birthplace of Crocs.  I'll continue to wear Crocs out of loyalty, but I'm not  ecstatic about these ""classic"" Crocs.  I put classic in quotation marks, because Crocs loyalists know that they were once made in the USA, and the shoes that were made in the USA were sized in ranges and were made of superior material that was a tad bit softer.  Please know that I'm traditionally not a hooah-hooah ""Made in the USA"" minion, but there are distinct differences between the USA- and Mexican-made Crocs.  Crocs made in Mexico are made of a similar (but different) material that has a slippery finish, and they are sized in whole-sizes only.  I resisted buying Mexican Crocs because of these material and fit factors, and so I wore down my USA Crocs to the end.I wear a 10.5 running show, and in the USA size Crocs I wore men's XL (10-11), which were perfect!  For the Mexican Crocs I ordered M11, but they were too large: too much play in the toes and too much length between the heel of the shoe and the heel of the foot.  I returned them for Mexican M10, which is what I settled on.  They're good with room in the toe, but I would have liked an extra half-inch on the heel.  This is why the USA sizing scheme was better FOR ME.  I acknowledge all feet are different.Some will say that the changes in workmanship came after the supposed slit of the company's founders due to a nasty divorce.  Search for that on the internet and decide for yourself.Props to Amazon for the consistent Prime service, and this was the first purchased I used the Amazon Locker feature, and that went well.  I appreciated this because I did Airbnb, and I didn't feel comfortable having a package delivered there.

That was a deal breaker for me (thankfully Amazon has a free return option!)Also - they felt somewhat large lengthwise (I'm normally 12 / 12.5 so I figured 12 would be on a smaller size but that was not the case).Finally - I didn't like the overall loose fit (I guess some would call it ""comfortable"" but I wouldn't dare to step outside in them; definitely couldn't run in them or even walk fast).Note for reference - I'm not a sandal / flip-flop, etc. person - I always wear regular, closed, well-fitting shoes.

Great for the yard, But do not leave out in the sun...
",Boston Audiophile,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are what you expect; waterproof, easy to clean and pretty darn comfortable. Great for yard work, gardening and for slipping on and off when you need quick foot ware. In other words, shoes when you're too lazy to put on regular shoes. Better than flip flops when you need some tootsie protection.My only complaint is if you leave these in the sun they will shrink considerably. I left mine on the back stoop where they get direct sun in the afternoon. The rubber shrank a full size smaller so they no longer fit. I live in Massachusetts where the sun isn't intense. But apparently afternoon UV exposure is enough to cook your Crocs. I have never seen this happen with flip flops that I have left outside. It's disappointing Crocs wouldn't have this figured out (i.e. UV resistant rubber, etc.) especially given their practical use in the yard.

  I wish wide sizes were available. If your feet are at all wide these will become uncomfortable really quick. I read about a trick, where you put on several pairs of thick socks, put these shoes in a hot dryer for a couple minutes, then force them on your feet to widen them a bit. It seemed to help a little, I suppose. Wish they had wide sizes available, otherwise the shoes are same quality as all Crocs, just OK.

",DJ,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  love this clunky little things, however, the fit is SO difficult. Have several different styles and as many of the reviews say, there is MUCH variance in the fit. While the length of these is accurate 7W/5M (I wear 6.5 normally) they are SO huge, I would need a couple of pairs of socks to keep them on. Returning.

Classic crocs still classic but sizing unpredictable.
",Sherry G.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have been wearing crocs for years, and these were just as expected except for the size.  Buyers beware.  I ordered the same size and style of unisex classic  crocs as my old ones.  They were significantly shorter.  Exchanged to the next size up, and they were identical to the old ones.  I could not have been mistaken because the size was still visible imprinted on the bottom of the old shoes.  I would give them 5 stars because I like crocs, but feel forced to downgrade because of size inconsistency.  How hard can it be to make a molded shoe conform to size?

Cute shoes.  But too small or too large if you're a true half size!
",Abbott,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I bought a size 9 (women) since I wear a 9 in a sandal.  I wear a 9.5 in a closed toe shoe.  But there was a recommendation in this description that half sizes should order down.  So I thought a size 9 would be just right for me.  Alas, they are too short.  The end of my toes touches the front of the shoe even without a sock.  So I immediately had to put them back in the box and return them.  According to my experience, one would order a size up, not a size down.  A 9 is too short for a 9.5 foot.  Still, they are very nice and attractive shoes, so I'm ordering a size 10.  I'm giving 5 stars because there was nothing wrong with the shoes, just bought the wrong size and don't think the description should have suggested ordering a size down.Update:  I have to change my rating from a 5 star to a 2 star for the simple reason that they will not work for someone like me with exactly 1/2 size off.  After the above-described experience (ordering a size 9 women for my 9.5 foot), I sent them back and ordered a size 10 women.  They are enormous.  I can't possibly wear them even with a very thick sock.  They fit me like boats.  I really wanted to like these, and except for their being a smidgeon too small in size 9, I really would have liked them.  I guess I have to give up on Crocs.  I would guess there are a lot of people like me in between sizes who can't make them work.  Much of the problem might be that when the size gets larger, both the length and the width increase.  I didn't need them any wider at all, just a tiny bit longer.  Too bad.

Disappointed!
",Martha,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These new Crocs are not as good as my old ones. I've bought Crocs for years, as gifts too. When mine finally got holes in the soles, I wanted a new pair after so many years. Looked at the new styles, but reviews said the fit was off, so decided to stay with the tried and true. The good old Croc!Well, NOT!  This is an imitation of what used to be. There is no arch support on the inner side which my old ones had. The bumps on the soles are hard and not comfortable at all. The only good thing going for this pair is that the heel support is still very good. I use them for walking the dogs rather than putting on socks and sneakers. But this pair has already given me a blister where the top rubbed my skin.Bad buy. Get a cheap pair someplace and put inserts in, then you may be able to walk in them.

There is a severe size distortion between the M7 and M8 sizes; the former is far too short and the latter is far too long for my foot.  The M7 is three times longer than the average difference between sizes!  Dear Crocs: please fix your quality control program!1. My shoe size is US 8 ¬Ω or 9 ‚Äì none of these Crocs sizes approximate a normal US shoe size.2. I ordered three pair in order to find the right fit.  None fit!  I compared these three sizes (all made in Mexico), with my wife‚Äôs  (made in Italy).  The current old pair that I wear, which fit perfectly, are ‚ÄúM6/7.‚Äù  The length differences between the four new pair is telling: M5 to M6*:0.3cm; M6* to M7: 0.7cm; M7 to M8: 1.7cm; M8 to M9: 0.3cma. M5 (Italy) 25.4cm (9 7/8in) long, 10.7cm (4 3/16in) wideb. M7 (Mexico) 26.7cm (10 1/2in) long, 10.7cm (4 1/4in) widec. M8 (Mexico) 28.4cm (11 1/8in) long, 11.2cm (4 3/8in) wided.

Comfortable but really hot

  I told myself I would never buy this style of Croc, but I figure as a house shoe, I could make an exception.  I have hard wood floors and am super pregnant, so every step was beginning to really hurt.  I've heard good things about these, so I bought the cheapest color in size huge because my feet are in fact, huge.  They fit fine and have definitely eliminated a lot of my foot pain, however, my feet are sitting in a sauna.  I have to wear socks with them and I still have super sweaty (and not to mention, stinky) feet. I'm not one to have ever had a sweaty or stinky foot issue, but in these I'm queen gross foot.  I knew this would be an issue to an extent, but wow, this is ridiculous.  I'll switch between these and my gel flip flops (which don't do much for me) throughout the day, just to give my feet a breather.  Are they comfortable?  Yes.  Would I have bought them if I knew how my feet would handle this material?  Nah.

  I have not found these sandals as comfortable as most people profess--especially at the price. I have a pair of take-off crocs I got at a discount store, and they have a softer sole, which makes them more comfortable.  I do have narrow feet, which may be a factor.  The Caymans are narrower than the Beach sandal and they do clean up nicely, but my feet swim in them, and I have worn them for a while now, and they do not seem to be conforming to my feet, as I thought they might.  In sum, if you have narrow feet and are seeking a softer shoe, you may not care for these.

  I bought crocs Men's 12132 Classic and returned them, buying this unisex classic instead.  The 12132 were made in China while these ones are made in Mexico.  I feel and see the difference in quality; the Mexican clogs feel a lot cheaper as though made from a lower quality plastic.  We'll see how long they last.

Lousy quality control on fitment, 10 to big, 9 way small.  Thats just nuts.
",Charles Hugh,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  never liked to look but bought a pair of cheapo knockoffs and wear them around the house, they walk great but the knockoff plastic in the upper is a little stiff so ordered the real deal  based on reviews.  Cost 5 times more money in the local store, about 35% less on AMZ.  The knockoffs are a US Mens 10 so ordered mens 10.  Well, they were so large they would not stay on.  Plastic is much more supple so I was sold on going with the Crocs.  Went to local store and tried mens 9 which felt fine so sent 10s back and ordered  a 9 but they are very small. Fit more like an 8 shoe.  They are so small my toes dig into the front.  So sending those back.  Great for walking and comfortable but even though they are obviously molded in one piece there must be differences from machine to machine, plant to plant or something.  I read that these will shrink in sunlight perhaps the 9s were sitting around a while an shrank?  Very disappointed and now another return back to Amazon.  Seems I'll have to go local to find a pair to fit.

Too Small
",Lisa Vouk,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I was disappointed with these crocs. I have bought them on Amazon before, but those actually fit me. These were too small, they seemed at least one size too small. I tend to round up a size with crocs anyway because they often run a little small. I compared these to a pair of size 10 crocs I already own, and they were significantly shorter in length. I was very unhappy with this purchase. From now on, I will now be buying my crocs in store, not online.

  I ordered a 11W/9M in size and gave this as a gift. Unfortunatley, the crocs were in a bag and I didn't take them out to make sure the size was correct, because I assumed I had been sent what I ordered. I was called a day later by the recipient and told that the size was wrong (I had been shipped was a 12W/10M, which was WAY too big!)  It is clearly marked on the bottom of the shoe, and I am so disappointed in Amazon for shipping me the wrong size.  The recipient had really needed these shoes, and rather than mess with a return, I had to go to a store to buy them, which put me out double the cost.  Don't order these online through Amazon--you don't know what size you'll get.

  Crocs have a very generous fit - so a wide shoe is to be expected.  The strap broke off the Crocs right away.  The shoes are getting returned.

Well, I bought a pair of real Crocs & used them on my kayak, but a month or so into the summer they had shrunk immensely (I‚Äôm talking several sizes).  Ok, maybe I just bought some from a bad batch, so I got on Amazon & bought another pair (a size too big in case they shrunk a little & white to lessen the heating). Well, they also shrunk down to the point where they are getting uncomfortable.  They are nice-looking shoes, but are just not usable for outdoors. Guess it‚Äôs back to Walmart for a pair of knockoffs. Really disappointed.

Before I even put them on I noticed they looked smaller, so I checked the size, which was right according to my old pair but they were significantly smaller.  Now I have a pair of Crocs I can't wear.  Definitely try them on before you detag them to make sure they will fit  the way you are expecting.

  I live in Crocs. They are the only shoes that I can wear and don't go to bed with so much foot pain I can't sleep. However, every time I order Crocs from Amazon, I fall for the sizing chart. It said if my foot measured 10 inches, heel to toes, I needed a women's size 9. Will my foot is exactly 10 inches and the size 9 ladies is way too big. I had to return them and ordered the size I have been wearing which is a 7. Next time I'll just order the 7 and forget about the inch measurement.

",Kimberlea Thompson,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These Crocs are one size too big, very inconsistent sizing.  Such a hassle to send back and then re-order a size smaller.  Usually ordering on Amazon is so convenient, but they wont accept a replacement since there was nothing (physically) wrong with the shoes.  So now they must be shipped back and I must place a separate order for the smaller size.  This is one example where going to a store would have been a better choice.

Sorry system for sizing on this description
",Ravenhill,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  If sizing on the order screen and description matched exactly what is on the shoes, it would help. I love the shoe, and the low stars are about ordering from this Amazon seller.The shoe itself reads M5 W7 has a tag that says ""M5/W7"" and is clearly labeled Made in Mexico. I'm returning them for another size up, hoping I don't get US sized ones which will then be too big.I've worn Crocs for years, and the way sizes were listed on this item description was confusing, as it did not match the ones I was wearing when I tried to place the order - which were made in the US - read ""W 8-9 M 6-7"". These were not an option. As a result, after measuring my foot, using the chart Crocs provides, etc etc I have a pair that is too small. I put a lot of thought into it and did not just push a random button.Ideally, the top and sides should not touch your foot when you are standing. They are supposed to fit that way....and so if you find them hot, it may be you are not in a large enough size.Annoyed that I now have a wait for the right shoe. Wish the brand would standardize the way shoes are labeled and that people selling it would then follow that method...and not lie about where the shoes are made, as in putting US in the title.

And that's true of this one, the Classic clog, so order down a half-size if your normal size happens to be one that Crocs doesn't make.It's important 'NOT' to overestimate which size you'll need is because the strap at the back will fall down if they're too large, causing your shoes to fall off, thus being essentially unwearable.LATE EDIT: After a month of wear, I decided to revisit my review. Part of my reason for reexamining my initial review is a change I've noticed is the rubberiness or softness of the material now used in my Crocs clogs. Besides their (apparent) tendency to wear out quicker, I now have problems with stability in them, which is a very important issue for me because of health issues.In all fairness, I have other Crocs, some sandals, which aren't composed of such soft material, but I'm not trying to analyze the decision-making process that led to the change. However the change came about, the newer clogs are now made of a poorer quality material. Moreover, the issue of stability is something I've monitored because of its importance to me. I've been chastened in my past experiences with Croc imitators, only to go back to Crocs once again. And now I find myself having to look elsewhere once more.

Comfortable, ugly shoes!
",Carmen Durango,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Man, I feel like these shoes are just so ugly.  But I got them because I needed something to wear around the house and yard that was supportive to my feet, and these are all that.  They are also pretty easy to clean with the hose, which is good in case I accidentally step in a doggy 'landmine'.  I have to say tho, that the look is just really hard for me to get over.  But if that is a concern, you can do as I do and stick to wearing them only at home.

  These are made in MEXICO.... do not buy! I have a pair of Crocs, that I still wear, that are 10 years old. They are soft, thick, rubber, and very roomy. They are a size 7. I purchased these in a size 7 and my heel hung off the back. I thought they might have been marked wrong on the size so I returned them and ordered another pair, same thing. They are a full size too small, and very hard rubber. Go to a Crocs store if you want real MADE IN THE USA Crocs that last forever.

Don't leave them in the sun they will shrink!
",River13,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have owned a pair of crocs for about 8 years and wanted a new style so I bought these. The old ones was made in China and the rubber is a lot different than the new crocs that are made now in Mexico. If you leave these crocs in the sun they will shrink a size down. My old crocs I store them on my back porch and they get full sun and have never shrunk. I left these new ones from Mexico in the sun for only a few hours and they are at lease 1/2 size smaller now. My big toe hits the end now as before it didn't. My husband bought a new pair last year and told me they are a lot different than our old pairs and he swore they shrunk when he left them outside but I didn't listen and when I got my new pair it did the same thing. The rubber on the Mexico one's is like a shiny rubber as the old one's from China is a dull rubber. The China ones seems a little thicker also. I don't know why the company started using Mexico to make them but I wished they would go back to China because the old ones are a lot better. I went to a store that sells them and checked them all and they are all made in Mexico. I think the old ones are more comfortable also.

  Crocs aren't cheap footwear anymore. They're still fine for everything but wearing to the office, but with ""Made in China"" on the bottom, I would think they'd be about half the price. Maybe we'll be making our own with 3-D printers some day.

  I've worn CROCS for years and have loved every pair...until now. CROCS quality has gone down hill. This pair was made in Mexico, and is sized much smaller and tighter than my previous CROCS which were made in China. Even at a reduced price, they weren't worth the cost. They rubbed uncomfortably across my arches and where the button strap joined the clog. The straps are too short for the size of the clog, and couldn't flip up over the arch. The left CROC strap was noticeably shorter than the right strap. When down, the straps down cut into my heel and pushed my toes uncomfortably into the front of the clog. I returned them.

Poor Quality & Size Problems
",VB,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Over the years I have fallen in love with my Crocs.  I have two pair, one made in China, and the other in Bosnia.  The fit great and have served me well.  This pair (made in Mexico) does not fit, they are too big.  They also feel thinner and even the straps that normally just fold up out of the way are not the same size.  If this is the new Crocs then I will find another brand and shame on the company for ruining a good product. If these are counterfeit, then shame on the supplier.  As always Amazon's return policy is quick & easy, however I  will still be paying $5 shipping. This is the second time I have ordered a clothing product from Amazon suppliers and the quality has been very sub standard.  In the future I will purchase such items locally and restrict my Amazon shopping to other categories.

Classic Crocs Fit Much Smaller
",Pamela J. Peerce Landers,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  If you are replacing a pair of old Classic Crocs today, be aware that the fit is much smaller. The length is 1/2 inches shorter. The width is narrower.  And, the strap is no longer flush with the back of the shoe, but 1/2 inch shorter. Result, a very tight uncomfortable shoe.The material of construction is also more rigid and less pliable.  New Crocs are more like Walmart knock-offs than like the original Crocs.I returned mine.  Will shop locally since sizing is now problematic. If shoes are rigid, will just wear my old ones into the ground.

Does not fit the fat
",Greek Witch,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  At 8 lbs a pop, I have what you might call fat feet. My whole life has been spent in envy of those endowed with more normal locomotory appendages. I can't wear sneakers, sandals, or loafers; sock after sock has split after insertion of my foot therein; each of my footsteps is a distinctive *splat* audible over a 100 meter radius. I thought that maybe, just maybe, Crocs would help me ""fit"" in. I've seen plenty of people wearing them around the trailer park - just once, might I be able to look like the cool kids? I was dead wrong. With the XXXL Crocs on my feet, I understood what Chinese foot binding must have felt like. Blood flow to the foot region slowed to such a trickle that each foot turned a mucous green. I had to use a steak knife to get the things off, cutting myself in the process, so that what little blood remained in my feet spurted all over my den and onto my adjacent daughter. I walked to the ER barefoot, cutting my feet yet further on the broken glass that littered the freeway shoulder. The nurses on staff snickered at me from behind their COVID masks. Moral of the story, you ask? Keep away from ""Crocs"" at all costs.

Crocs Review Correction
",MMP,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I originally left a positive review but after wearing these Crocs the size was just too small.  I purchased a pair of Khaki Crocs in April this year from Amazon and the size was perfect.  These Crocs were definitely smaller.  I thought I could make it work but then decided to return.  I was not offered to exchange for another pair.  This made me think that they know that this color in their Crocs was mis-sized.  If they would have offered another pair sized correctly, I would have definitely exchanged.  The color is really nice.

Not all crocs are made equally
",PR,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have gotten two pairs of crocs off of the actual website and I was pleased with them. When I saw Amazon had some at a cheaper price, I decided to try them using prime wardrobe. As soon I got them and tried them on, I immediately noticed a difference. The toe box was a little smaller and my feet would slide out when I would walk. I compared them to the crocs I got on the website, and the ones from Amazon definitely looked lower quality. The ""crocs TM"" logo across the strap wasn't as defined and the edges along the sides of the shoes weren't as smooth. The grips on the inside of the shoe weren't as defined either which is probably why my feet would slide out.. I looked at the tags and the ones I got from Amazon were made in Brazil while my other crocs from the website were made in Vietnam. I did research online and found that Crocs indeed has multiple factories across the globe, so the ones I were sent were likely NOT fakes. However, I am not the first person to note that the factories in Asia use a different mold than the ones in Brazil. Other people have also noticed a higher quality from the ones made in Vietnam. I TRIED to get myself to like these ones, but I just couldn't. Even if they were cheaper, I could TELL they were cheaper just by looking at them. I had to send them back. It's a shame that Crocs doesn't require the same mold and quality at all their locations. The lack of consistency is disappointing.

The little bumps on the sole of each shoe are very pointy and irritating.  Why do Crocs length and fit differ so much each time I order the exact same size and style?!?!  Waste of money.

",D. Deutsch,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I finally bought a pair of Crocs after finding them for the reasonable price of $19.99 on Amazon. I like Crocs, but I refuse to pay something like $30 to $45 for what essentially amounts to a pair of plastic slippers. I was skeptical of their usefulness, but they fill the niche (for me) between slippers and clogs pretty well.The fit was surprisingly small. I mean they are wide and clunky, but seem to run a bit short; I bought the 9 for my 8 1/2 foot, but there is not as much room in the toe-box as I expected. Despite being plastic, the shoes breathes very well and are comfortable enough for extended wear. Running to the mailbox or cleaning the house is an ideal use for this type of footwear. Beware taking out the garbage in the morning as the dew seeping through the holes will come as unwelcome surprise.Not that I knew I needed them, but Crocs are popular for a reason.  They are great for lounging around, but I am skeptical at the touted advantages of some of the more specialized models. Now, having bought a pair I feel existentially complete.Update 10/12/2012I am writing this review after about a week's worth of wear. The fit was simply too small and I had to give them away. I am trying the men's size 10 to see if they will be more comfortable. In my case it may be a matter of going a full size up.

  I am a woman who wears a size 10. The length is exaxt, and while I do understand the sizes were unisex, these are extremely wide for a normal sized ladies foot. My foot slides side to side in them. I also thought there would be at least a 1/2"" lift from front to back since there appears to be deep sole, however it is actually totally flat because your heel sits lower than the top edge of the heel. There are air holes that go around the front and sides of the shoe, and one in the front is in the exact place that my second toe sticks through it and debris gets in. The strap can swing frontward or backwards, however when it's backwards, it barely touches my heel since it's so long. It's not as cushy soft as other crocs I've tried on. They are something to kick around in, but nothing I would have bought had I tried them on at the store. I think I will stick to the ones made specifically for women.

I needed to return them because there was no way they were going to properly fit my foot. I still want a pair but I am worried that the next size up will not fit correctly either.

A little disappointing for a long time crocs wearer..
",Janet's Hartsburg,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I've been a dedicated crocs wearer for years for both work and play. I probably haven't bought a new pair for a couple years but finally decided it was necessary for safety reasons (when the tread is totally worn off they can be very slippery). The pair that I purchased was an A+ for comfort, as always. However, the construction of the shoe has been cheapened considerably. The straps spontaneously pop off, requiring that you realign and replace the heel strap to the croc. Have crocs become a victim of their own popularity..?

  These crocs are extremely practical despite the way they look. Feels like you are walking on air.  They are great when I wear socks with them but when I go without socks, they rub the top of both of my feet in the same place (where you would normally have shoe laces on a shoe) causing blisters/cuts.  Maybe I just need to get used to them, not sure.  Anyhow, these are great clogs with one major drawback.

Even with socks they are so big they will not stay on my foot. That includes using the strap,they are just to big.

",como651,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I used to love Crocs.  My first pair were the Classics then I got the slippers then the Yukon Sports and told everyone how great they were.  I could not have been so far from the truth.  These shoes keep podiatrists in business.  After 3 years of wearing my Classics nearly every day of the summer and spring I started to feel a growing discomfort in my knees when walking and especially when going down steps and began to suspect the Crocs when I noticed uneven treadwear.  I went to a podiatrist and he said the Crocs due to their spongy sole where not providing support or stabilizing my knees correctly.  He said I was experiencing pronation as a result which explained the uneven tread wear. He recommended Keen shoes instead.  I tried them on and it was immediate relief.  I could literally feel the pressure redistribute in my knees.  It felt like someone opened a pressure valve within my knee joints!  I also learned Crocs act as isolators and cause static electricity buildup which explains now why I regularly would get shocked when stepping out of my van.  Lastly, they are slippery as snot on wet concrete.  Almost went down several times.  They may feel soft on the feet but these things are the devil in disguise.

  I ordered two pairs of Crocs - one pair of thongs and one pair of cayman crocs. I used the sizing chart provided and ordered both pairs in M5/W7. However, when they arrived, while the Thongs fit perfectly, with room to wiggle, the Caymans were way too small (I'd almost say a full size too small). The Thongs were ""made in China"" and the Caymans ""made in Mexico"". I went to my local store and discovered that they receive Croc orders which are often made in multiple countries. It would appear to me that there is no ""standard"" mold used. So beware - just because you have tried them on in a store and think you have the correct size - you may end up getting a larger or smaller size, depending on where they are manufactured.

  Wir haben gleich 3 Paar dieser Schuhe in unterschiedlichen Gr√∂√üen und Farben gekauft. Da wir diese Schuhe im Garten und auf der Terrasse benutzen wollten, lagen sie bei uns immer drau√üen. Nach einigen Tagen in der Sonne sind sie so eingeschrumpelt, dass man unm√∂glich noch seinen Fu√ü hinein bekommt. Die schwarze 43/44 passt h√∂chstens noch jemandem mit Schuhgr√∂√üe 36, und die dunkelblaue 42/43 kann niemand mehr tragen, da sie sich zus√§tzlich auch noch vorne extrem nach oben gebogen haben und jetzt gute Clownsschuhe beim Kinderfasching w√§ren. Das dritte Paar hat sich nur ein wenig verzogen, vermutlich weil es die hellblauen waren und da die Sonne nicht so draufbrezelt. Geht jedenfalls √ºberhaupt nicht f√ºr den Preis! H√§tte ich bei 5‚Ç¨ Schuhen erwartet. Wenigstens ein Hinweis, dass man die Schuhe nicht in die Sonne legen darf, w√§re wichtig!

  Die Schuhe passen gut und sind bequem. Da ich sie haupts√§chlich im Garten und auf der Terrasse benutzt habe, standen sie logischerweise auch mal in der Sonne - mit dem Ergebnis, dass sie nach nur 3-4 Wochen mindestens 3 Gr√∂√üen geschrumpft sind! Im ersten Moment dachte ich, dass ein Kind seine Schuhe aus Versehen bei uns stehen gelassen hat, weil ich mir gar nicht erkl√§ren konnte, wieso ich pl√∂tzlich nicht mehr in die Schuhe passte!Dabei wirbt der Hersteller mit ""der perfekte Schuh f√ºr Strand oder Boot!"" Nur darf die Sonne eben nicht l√§nger scheinen. Amazon hat kulanterweise den Schuh zur√ºckgenommen und den Kaufpreis erstattet, obwohl die Frist zur R√ºckgabe bereits verstrichen war.Da bereits mehrere K√§ufer von demselben Ph√§nomen berichten, sollte man den Schuh auf keinen Fall kaufen, wenn man vorhat, ihn auch drau√üen zu benutzen. Sehr entt√§uschend.

  They have changed the shape and feel of Classic Crocs which I think is a shame. I prefer the rounded wide front and squishiness of my old style crocs, these are considerably narrower at the front. I'm sure they have done this to try and make them less disagreeable to the anti-croccers, but actually they look more silly in their new slimline shape. They are also firmer- I preferred them soft.

  I ordered these for my husband as a Christmas present.  He is size 7 so clicked on that size.  When they arrived they were good quality but looked too big, so Christmas surprise spoilt for him as I had to ask him to try them on just in case they were OK - but no they were much to big.  When I checked to bottom of the Crocs it said size 8.When you order the sizing chart shows mens size 7/women size 8 which I presume is wrong as generally women have smaller feet but quite what determines which size you get who knows a crystal ball maybe. I have had to return them so a complete waste of my time and a Christmas surprise spoilt.I now have a dilemma,  do I re-order size 6 hoping to get size 7 or just forget the whole thing.I noticed in the reviews that the quality is not generally in question but that wrong sizing  is a frequent complaint so maybe time the production information was corrected and customers stopped wasting their time..

  Others have commented on the strange sizing of Crocs, which seems to depend on whether they're made in Italy or China. I already had a pair of size 7s, which are roomy, so I only wear them round the house and garden.  And my son wears them (he's a size 9).  I needed something big to wear following a broken ankle so ordered a pair of black size 7.  They arrived and were visibly much smaller than the ones I already had. Small pair made in Italy, large pair made in China, both purporting to be size 7.  Really annoying.  I exchanged for a size 8 which is about the right size on my 'normal' foot - but I'm not usually an 8!Surely such a well known brand should be able to get its sizing right!

  The soles inside most Crocs have very small, slightly raised bobbles, presumably to invigorate one's feet, except these can cause nerve damage over time to diabetics' feet like my husband's and he has many various wide styles of other shoe makes bought from Amazon and been very satisfied. Eventually after only a fortnight, his Crocs were causing considerable nerve pain, so he bought gel insoles to prevent further discomfort.Otherwise Crocs are very comfy. They come in a variety of great colours and whose straps help keep one's feet safety inside the shoe.I wrote to Crocs many times, only to receive no reply.

  Sadly, I cannot get on with these crocs. I persevered for 2 days as I have used crocs every Summer for at least 20m years.I cannot wear these however as I think that the raised areas on the soles are too high.  The bottoms of my feet were too painful to persevere and further.By the raised areas, I mean the many bumps in the shoes.I printed a label and sent these crocs back to you last week so you should  have received them by now.  No sign of a refund to dateThese were returned via hermes on 26/05/2020. I guess hermes still has them.

  I usually buy Croc lookalikes (or mock crocs as I refer to them) from a well known high street shoe shop, but they seem to wear down on the heel quite quickly, so I thought I'd try the branded one's. I have wide feet, so purchase men's size 7 in the mock croc version. Other reviewers stated that sizing depended greatly on where their Crocs were made, but as I had no idea in advance which version I would receive, I thought I should stick with a size 7. I have to say mine are a little on the small side - not only narrower but also shorter in length. I wear them instead of slippers, so during the summer months they fit fine, but I cannot wear them with socks once it gets cooler - there simply isn't enough room in them. I think in future I will stick with the 2 pairs for ¬£8.00 mock crocs, and just replace them more often. I find it rather ironic that a cheaper high street pair, is more generously sized than the expensive branded version.

  Crocs are the best of a poor choice. The soles wear out in about 3 months so the real price is much higher. However they are amazing at keeping your feet cool and they're very comfortable. If Crocs could actually produce some modern progressive Clog designs they'd get five stars but their design or possibly their marketing department lets them down. Hire some good designers and let them do their job. We don't need wacky shoes with crazy two tone color schemes, just well designed ones.

  I was slightly disappointed by these. The insoles did not feel as comfortable or supportive as I'd hoped, and the size of the shoe was almost too short for my feet- it felt like my heel was hanging off the end of the shoe. However, width-wise, they felt too loose around my foot and wouldn't stay on unless I used the strap, which then pushed my foot forwards and squashed my toes. I wanted to use these as shoes/slippers to jump in and out of around the house, therefore they are no good for me and I will be returning them.

  I bought these as advertised size 6. When they arrived it said on the sole, women's size 8 and men's size 6. I am keeping them as they might be better with socks, in winter. However, if this had been clear on the advert, I would have bought a smaller size. It didn't say on the description on Amazon that it was Unisex and gave absolutely NO indication that size 6 meant men's size 6 which is different from women's size 6!! Size 6, to me, is unisex as in all other shops/shoes, a men's (or boys') size 6 is the right size for me.I am keeping them as I needed them urgently for work and it's too much hassle to return them as I will have nothing to wear at work in the meantime but PLEASE in future make this sizing VERY clear!!

  I have bought at least 20 pairs of Crocs and these are the first that don't quite fit. I would much rather have paid the extra ¬£10 and had a normal fit. The ones that I took off were sized 6 - 8 and made in Italy, just exactly the same as the new ones, but the new ones are slightly wider and have slightly bigger holes. Not happy, but these were the only Crocs on Amazon so no choice either.

  I bought these Crocs because I have other colours which I love, but these black ones appear to be of inferior quality.  The plastic is a lot harder and ungiving and therefore not nearly as comfortable.  Maybe they will soften in time, but I see no reason why a different colour should be any different in quality, especially as the price remains the same and I suspect these are manufactured by a different company, using cheaper materials.

  I read various reviews about crocs before ordering, and gathered from most that the sizings can be hit or miss. I therefore ordered two different styles and two different sizes.Jolly glad that i did. My normal size is a 6, but the size 6 that i ordered looked more like a childs shoe. There was no way my feet were going to fit into those. The pair i ordered in a different size and style fitted perfectly. My advice for this product would be to either order two pairs in different sizes or go for 2 sizes bigger than you would normally wear.

My sister returned the crocs and decided not to take a chance on the next size being a better fit and buy locally therefore able to try  on and save the possibly of having to return if wrong size. My advice  see if you can find out where they were made before buying and if China take a bigger size.  difficult to give a rating as the product is good but incorrectly sized.

  I've bought several pairs of Crocs previously and have had no problem with them.  However this pair are a poor fit and far too squashy.  They were made in China and I note my last pair were made in Italy and were much better.  With hidesight I should have returned them, however I've worn them and thrown away the packaging.  Unfortunately I'm unable to wear them any more.  I'm convinced the right one is wider than the left but can't prove it.  I will be more careful next time.

  Die Crogs wurden schnell geliefert.Eigentlich ist 1 Stern zuwenig, aber ich war so irritiert als sie kamen, das ich erst dachte eine Kopie gekauft zu haben.Die Gr√∂√üe ist nun ganz anders als ""fr√ºher""Ich habe derzeit - wie auf dem Bild zu sehen - ganz alte Crogs die mindestens 10 Jahre alt sind. Nun sind sie durchgelaufen, und einer an in der Sohle ein Loch. Deshalb mussten neue her.Ich habe die Gr√∂√üe, die 37/38 angegeben ist gekauft.Sie passen mir wie erwartet. Dennoch wundert es mich, das die alten eine Nummer kleiner waren, aber dennoch gr√∂√üer sind als die neuen.Also kauft jemand dieselbe Gr√∂√üe wie seine alten sind, werden sie viiiiiiiel zu gro√ü sein.Auf meinen alten steht noch ""Made in Italy"" auf den neuen ""Made in Vietnam"". Tja....Au√üerdem finde ich das die neuen h√§rter sind als die alten. Nicht mehr so flexibel.Fazit:Man kann sie kaufen, zumindest meine Farbe war g√ºnstig, aber andere sind teurer, und da w√ºrde ich schon nicht mehr empfehlen.Ich bin sehr gespannt wie sie sich in der Sonne verhalten, denn einige schreiben sie w√ºrden schrumpfen.Wenn dem so ist, haben sie nicht mal 1 Stern verdient.Meine jetzigen haben in all den Jahren ihre Gr√∂√üe beibehalten.Ich bin gespannt, und sollte dem so sein, das sie sich ver√§ndern werde ich leider nie wieder welche kaufen.

  I have chosen 2 stars not for the product, Crocs are brilliant, it is the sizing. I ordered a size 6 but received a size 5/6 and it was more of a 5. Instead of my son having them I have kept them for myself. I am now reluctant to purchase anymore from Amazon as it is always a pain to return goods. Also if you order a particular size you don't expect to receive a different one. Size 6 would have been fine.

  Ein schlechter Scherz??? Lustig und traurig zugleich.

Mein Sohn freute sich und meinte: ""cool, dann kann ich sie ja haben, wenn sie dem Papa nicht mehr passen!""Seine Freude war nur kurz, den ein Paar Tage sp√§ter passten sie ihm auch nicht und irgendwann dem J√ºngsten auch nicht mehr.

  I've been wearing Crocs for years and have more than 10 Pairs but something is really strange with the sizing of these Crocs.I wanted the color Orange and ordered the same size Crocs that I normally wear Size 10 womens / 8 mens ... oddly enough the Orange Crocs size 10W/8M were bigger (longer) than my other 10/8 Crocs ... weird?I read other reviews describing the same problem with sizing but didn't think they were accurate ... turns out they are.I tried to order a Size Smaller however Amazon didn't have Orange stock in the 9/7 size so I ended up returning them for a refund.I love CROCS and will continue to buy them although I am confused as to why this particular order and size didn't fit.Thankfully Amazon has a great return policy ... Hopefully they get more stock and I'll order again in a smaller size.

  Die Crocs wurden wie angek√ºndigt von Amazon geliefert. Zun√§chst passte auch alles. Habe absichtlich eine Nummer gr√∂sser bestellt. Die Schuhe waren angenehm zu tragen. Nach 5 Wochen und einigen Tagen aufenthalt der Crocs auf der Terasse waren diese um min. 2 Nummern geschrumpft. Zudem hatten sich die Schuhe so in L√§ngsachse verwunden das ein reinschl√ºpfen kaum m√∂glich ist. Das Tragen ist durch die Verwindung auch sehr unangenhem.Der Kundenservice von Amazon ist wirklich sehr freundlich. Ich bekomme ein neues Paar schuhe kostenlos zugeschickt. Ich werde es so gut wie m√∂glich vermeiden die Schuhe in praller Hitze liegen zu lassen, um die Schrumpfung und Verwindung zu vermeiden. Ich habe das Gef√ºhl das die Hersteller von dern urspr√ºnglichen Materialmischung abgewichen sind. Crocs trage ich seit 8 Jahren. Dieses Problem ist in diesem Umfang neu f√ºr mich.Ich bin mir am √ºberlegen ob ich 1 oder 2 Sterne geben soll. Ich gebe jetzt einen Stern, weil ich den Schuh eben meistens in den Sommermonaten trage. Sollte die Nachsendung besser halten, werde ich meine Bewertung entsprechend anpassen.

  I use to love crocs.  The new crocs are not the same size as the old ones.  As I have many issues with my feet, I have been wearing Crocs for a number of years.  I had read reviews about the sizing not being the same. I do agree.  They are also not making them with same quality as the older ones.  I wrote to Crocs company and said they were not any better than your department store shoe.  Except department store knock offs are much cheaper.  I have loads of knock offs.

  Ich brauchte dringend Gartenschuhe und habe mir daher die klassischen Crocs gekauft. Grunds√§tzlich sind die Schuhe gut verarbeitet, bequem und sehen hochwertig aus. Man kann sehr schnell rein und auch wieder rausschl√ºpfen, was f√ºr mich eine wichtige Voraussetzung f√ºr Gartenschuhe ist.Leider sind die Schuhe so weit geschnitten, dass mein (eher schmal geschnittener) Fu√ü komplett darin verloren ist und ich absolut keinen guten Halt habe.  Ich habe mir eine Billigmarke als Vergleich dazu bestellt und habe bei diesem das Problem mit der Weite nicht, zahle nur die H√§lfte und habe einen vergleichbar guten Schuh. Deshalb muss ich die Crocs wieder zur√ºckschicken und werde mir die Billigvariante stattdessen behalten.

Avendo un 43 abbondante , ho acquistato per uso domestico con fiducia la misura 43-44 che per√≤ ho trovato un po' larga. Non volendo restituire per cambio taglia pi√π piccolo per evitare di ritrovarmi, a detta di chi ha comprato la misura giusta, con un sandalo troppo calzante, ho preferito tenerli. Trovo il prodotto orribile dal design stile infermiere, ma risulta davvero leggero al piede e piacevole con il suo plantare. Trovo anche che si debba calzare necessariamente un calzino anche per casa per evitare che il piede cuocia al suo interno. Non capisco gli entusiasti di questa marca. Buona passeggiata...

  Zun√§chst machen die Crocs einen vern√ºnftigen Eindruck. Aber nach nur ungef√§hr 7 Monaten passen die Schuhe √ºberhaupt nicht mehr, da sich die Sohle durchgebogen hat und die Schuhe nun deutlich zu klein sind. Dabei wurden die Schuhe in der Zeit (vor allem √ºber den Winter) nur wenig getragen.Bei dem zeitgleich bestellten Modell meiner Frau treten diese Probleme nicht auf. Allerdings sind diese auch ""Made in Italy"" und nicht wie bei mir ""Made in Mexico"". Insgesamt kann ich von diesem Kauf daher nur abraten.Nachtrag: Ich habe die schwarze Version bestrellt (Roomy Fit).

  Ich habe mir vor etwa einem halben Jahr ein Paar dieser Crocs bestellt und wollte dann noch ein zweites Paar in derselben Gr√∂√üe und selben Farbe.Als ich das zweite Paar erhielt, habe ich zuerst bemerkt, dass diese um einiges enger geschnitten waren als das Paar mit derselben Gr√∂√üenangabe und mir daher √ºberhaupt nicht passten. Bei genauem Hinsehen und Vergleich fiel mir dann auf, dass sich das neue auch sonst von meinem ""alten"" Paar unterschied. Mein altes Paar war laut Aufdruck Made in Vietnam, das neue Paar Made in Bosnia. Zudem war der neue Farbton d√ºnkler.Offenbar unterscheiden sich die Produkte aus den verschiedenen Herstellerl√§ndern doch massiv, daher besteht hier das Risiko, ein f√ºr einen ""schlechteres"" Paar zu erwischen, mein zweites Paar ging daher zur√ºck.

  Ich vermag die vielen guten Bewertungen hier beim besten Willen nicht nachzuvollziehen. Die Clogs sehen gut aus und sind am Anfang auch tats√§chlich bequem. Ich habe davon insgesamt 3 verschiedene Modelle in verschiedenen Farben. Alle 3 Modelle verformen sich bei W√§rme und schmelzen bei Sonneneinstrahlung (Norddeutschland nicht Sahara) unter freiem Himmel locker um 2 Gr√∂√üen. Mit Sonneneinstrahlung meine ich weder Wintergarten oder Treibhaus, sondern wenige Stunden auf der Terrasse oder auf dem Eingangspodest vom Haus. Im Ergebnis mithin billigstes Material mit dem Schwerpunkt auf die Optik ohne jeglichen Qualit√§tsanspruch. Ich kann keine der drei Clogspaare mehr gebrauchen.

Compr√© la talla 41-42 de color NEGRO, que es equivalente a unas 10-12 porque ya ten√≠a unas blancas con esa talla, pero compradas en una tienda f√≠sica. Me llegaron y como se ve en la fotograf√≠a hay mucha diferencia con la misma talla, me quedan muy peque√±as.Pens√© que lo mismo estaban mal mis anteriores blancas, es muy raro que el mismo fabricante cambie tanto de talla y las he utilizado sin cerrar por detr√°s.El tema es que compr√© a mi mujer otras en otro vendedor de color ROSA talla 39-40 que es el equivalente a ellos 7-9 y pude comprobar que incluso son m√°s grandes que las que compr√© 41-42.Al final se ha quedado mi mujer con las negras porque no hay nada peor que ir con un calzado peque√±o.Es decir son las tallas de este vendedor las que son m√°s peque√±as que las otras y eso quiere decir que o est√°n mal rotuladas o no son aut√©nticas

  Tr√®s d√©√ßue par cette commande ""bleu navy"" que j'ai renvoy√©e car c'√©tait de fausses crocs, made in china, trop grandes, trop larges, dures, inconfortables alors que le plastique des vraies crocs est souple et doux. Auparavant j'avais command√© une paire d'un autre bleu, √† peine plus cher, made in italy, tr√®s agr√©able au pied mais un peu trop petite (38-39). Je croyais donc recevoir le m√™me mod√®le dans la taille au-dessus (39-40). H√©las non. Dans ce mod√®le de crocs, c'est la loterie. On ne peut se fier ni √† la taille, ni au prix.

  Sono purtroppo costretta a rivedere la prima recensione ... Dopo qualche giorno di utilizzo pi√π intensivo al mare, le ciabatte si sono ristrette di almeno una taglia ed ora non calzano pi√π... con il risuotato di essere inutilizzabili.Lascio, per completezza, la prima entusiastica recensione scritta non appena ricevuto e provato il prodotto... Ottime, calzano alla perfezione ed hanno l'inconfondibile qualit√† delle vere crocs. Arrivate imballate nella confezione originale, non fanno la puzza delle imitazioni economiche, indossate sono come un guanto e non provocano fastidi n√© sfregamento

  Ich wollte mir k√ºrzlich ein weiteres/neues Paar Crocs kaufen. Laut Beschreibung und Artikelname ist dieses Produkt exakt ""bauglich"" zu meinen bisherigen Schuhen. Als die neuen Schuhe dann geliefert wurden, die Entt√§uschung: Leider handelt es sich um ein v√∂llig anderes Material (fester, kaum weiche/nachgiebiges Fu√übett mit sehr unangenehm festen ""Noppen""). Ich habe die Schuhe daher zur√ºckgesandt und werde nun in Ladengesch√§ften nach Ersatz suchen m√ºssen.Ich kann mir diese Sache nur so erkl√§ren, da√ü Crocs an verschiedenen Produktionsstandorten weltweit hergestellt werden und es hier von Standort zu Standort massive Abweichungen in der Qualit√§t geben mu√ü.

  Allora o sono io che ho problemi a comprare crocs su amazon o c'√® qualche problema di fondo con tutte le crocs made in Vietnam. Prima di queste avevo provato il modelo crocband (arrivate sempre made in vietnam) e gi√† con quelle avevo problemi di taglia e di dolore alle ginocchia per come era stata costruita male la pianta del piede. Dopo il primo reso per la taglia ho deciso di cambiare e di prendere il modello classico che conoscevo, sperando d andare sul sicuro. Arrivate, comode, il problema √® che le due scarpe sono di dimensioni diverse. Ma che bello. Entrambe hanno impresso lo stesso numero sulla suola ma la scarpa destra √® pi√π grande della sinistra, e la differenza si nota gi√† ad occhio nudo. Fantastico. Quindi ora dovendo fare l'ennesimo reso nasce il dilemma: quale delle due scarpe rappresenta la taglia giusta? Il ""39/40"" dichiarato dovrebbe essere la sinistra che mi calza perfetta, o la destra che mi calza larga? Tra parentesi, normalmente porto un 38/39. Quindi il dilemma √®: devo riordinare la stessa taglia o prenderne una pi√π piccola? Questo sempre sperando che le scarpe mi arrivino della stessa dimensione a sto giro e non sia un problema dell'intera partita. Cio√® dai. O sono sfigata io o non si pu√≤.

  Wir hatten orangefarbene und hellgr√ºne Crocs, die nach vielen Jahren zu ersetzen waren.Haben durch dunkelblaue (""Navy"") in identischer Gr√∂√üe ersetzt. Nach 2-3 Wochen waren diese allerdings um gut 2 Nummern geschrumpft (dass es gut 2 Nummern waren, wei√ü ich erst jetzt, siehe weiter unten ...)Wenn man dazu im Web recherchiert, bzw. weit in den Tiefen der Crocs-Website, findet man die Hinweise,1. dass man Crocs nicht der Sonne aussetzen soll, was bei Outdoor-Schuhen, die auch mal auf der Terrasse bleiben, nat√ºrlich unsinnig ist bzw.2. dass Crocs aus einem besonderen Material w√§ren und sich dadurch an die F√º√üe Ihrer/s Tr√§gerIn anpassen w√ºrden.Wir haben mittlerweile folgende Ersatz-Crocs gekauft:a) 1 Paar in gleicher Farbe (""Navy""), aber 1 Nummer gr√∂√üer als ben√∂tigt=> sind erwartungsgem√§√ü wieder GESCHRUMPFT, aber offenbar UM  M E H R  ALS 1 NUMMER :((b) ein Paar rote (""Pepper""), ebenfalls 1 Nummer gr√∂√üer - UND DIE SCHRUMPFEN JETZT NICHTFAZIT:Man kann sich bei Crocs auf die Gr√∂√üe offensichtlich nicht verlassen, nach meiner Erfahrung schrumpfen dabei nur Schuhe in dunklen Farben.

  Ich hatte mir vor Jahren in den USA Crocs gekauft und habe sie geliebt. Sie standen bei Wind und Wetter vor der T√ºr und waren einwandfrei. Nachdem das Profil komplett abgelaufen war, habe ich mir dann diese hier bestellt. Zu Anfang war alles einwandfrei, sie waren nur gef√ºhlt etwas enger als die alten. Zwischendurch habe ich mich gewundert, warum der eine Schuh pl√∂tzlich dr√ºckt und reibt, aber nicht weiter dar√ºber nachgedacht warum. Den Sommer √ºber standen sie dann unbenutzt neben der T√ºr, da ich √ºberwiegend barfu√ü oder mit Flipflops unterwegs war. Heute wollte ich sie mit Socken wieder anziehen und habe sie nicht mehr an die F√ºsse bekommen. Sie sind locker 2 Gr√∂ssen geschrumpft und haben sich verformt.

Es w√§re noch nicht mal so schlimm, wenn er sich vielleicht nun wieder beim Tragen dehnt, aber nun ist er auch eine Nummer k√ºrzer und man steht st√§ndig auf dem Fersenteil. Davon abgesehen wirkt auch der nicht geschrumpfte Schuh nach einem Monat des Tragens als Hausschuh schon irgendwie ausgelatscht. Das waren meine ersten und letzten Paar Crocs.

  There are various ways to buy this product from this one page, and you will receive the same Crocs product either way, (which can be comfortable if you find the right size) but depending on colour/size availability, you may inadvertently purchase from a third-party seller.  If this happens, be aware that the return policy will require you to pay for return shipping for the ""privilege"" of trying them on, in my case, over $18.  This should be stated more clearly somewhere on the purchase page.  Along with the confusing sizing chart, just be very careful to buy from Amazon so that, if you're not quite sure that you will like them and that they will fit, you can return them without cost.

Grunds√§tzlich kann man die Schuhe nicht miteinander vergleichen, das Material ist deutlich h√§rter, das Fersenband zu lang. Irgendwie erinnern mich die Schuhe an einen Krabbeltisch im Discounter wo man Vergleichbares f√ºr 5 Euro bekommt. Bisher gab es Made in Italy, jetzt Bosnia... Schade

I actually ordered 4 pairs of crocs and so far received 3 pairs. 1 pair (pink) was for myself and so far has been the only pair I‚Äôm actually satisfied with. I‚Äôm giving 2 stars because the sizing I‚Äôve received for at least half this order is so far disappointing to say the least. My partner will likely never wear the pair I got him so that‚Äôs a waste of $50.

  Die Crocs waren f√ºr den Einsatz meiner Tochter im Krankenhaus bestimmt. Hat auch ein paar Tage funktioniert. Dann ist der Verschluss kaputt gegangen. Kann passieren. Einen Ersatzverschluss kann man nicht kaufen. Auf meine Mitteilung hin - √ºber Amazon - gab es bis heute keine R√ºckmeldung. Immerhin mehr als 14 Tage sind vergangen. Das ist nicht nett.

  Es gibt von diesen Crocs, zwei Versionen: die ""Made in China"" und die ""Made in Italy"". Ich hatte bisher immer die ""Made in China"" in Gr√∂√üe 12 und war mit denen auch h√∂chst zufrieden. Jetzt wollte ich meine gewohnte Gr√∂√üe 12 nachbestellen, bekam aber erstmals ""Made in Italy"". Das Material erscheint hochwertiger und weicher. Daf√ºr passen sie aber nicht mehr so gut wie die ""Made in China"". Sie fallen gr√∂√üer aus! Da sich die Crocs beim Tragen noch weiten, geht das gar nicht. Ich tausche jetzt gegen eine Nummer kleiner aus und wenn die dann passt, gibt's auch wieder 5 Sterne.

  Nach der Lieferung der ersten Bestellung musste ich feststellen, dass diese Schuhe zun√§chst sehr gro√ü geschnitten sind. Dies sollte sich jedoch rasch √§ndern: Die Ersatzlieferung wurde eine Nummer kleiner bestellt und passte perfekt. Allerdings nur bis zum ersten Sommertag. Ein Tag im Garten war ausreichend um die Gr√∂√üe von 42 auf 40/41 zu reduzieren. Mittlerweile haben die Schuhe so um die Gr√∂√üe 38 erreicht. Daher kann man jedem nur davon abraten, diese ""Schuhe"" im Freien zu benutzen. Von Seiten eines Markenherstellers ist es eigentlich eine Frechheit so ein Produkt in Umlauf zu bringen.Dieses Produkt ist schlicht und einfach nur Plastikm√ºll und muss der ordnungsgem√§√üen Entsorgung zugef√ºhrt werden.

  Pague casi 25 euros, a mi parecer nada baratas, las compre hace a√±o y medio y van aguantando bien el uso diario, pero no me han llegado a convencer del todo, solo los utilizo con calcetines y normalmente en invierno porque en verano me hacen sudar los pies. Pone que est√°n hechos en mejico, de talla me vinieron perfectas y el color era el que quer√≠a, aunque el acabado final del producto era bastante mejorable, con rebarbas en muchas partes y son bastante mas anchas de lo que me esperaba.

  Meine Tochter liebt ihre Crocs und f√ºr den Kanu Urlaub in Schweden waren diese Schuhe genau das Richtige. Seit dem Urlaub nutzen wir die Schuhe haupts√§chlich f√ºr den Garten und lassen sie  nichts B√∂ses ahnend auf der √ºberdachten  Terrasse stehen und jetzt der Schock, sie sind tats√§chlich um ca. 3 Gr√∂√üen geschrumpft. Daneben stehen auf der Terrasse auch ein Paar Billig-Crocs-Plagiate die immer noch die Form und die Farbe wie am Anfang haben, da kann doch etwas nicht stimmen. Dann kaufe ich doch lieber die billige Kopie und verzichte auf den Markennamen.

  Ich suchte weisse Clogs f√ºr die Arbeit im medizinischen Bereich. F√ºr mich pers√∂nlich war der Schuh etwas zu breit obwohl ich keine schmalen F√º√üe habe.

  Prinzipiell sind die Schuhe echt klasse. Sie sind sehr bequem und ich kann sie im Sommer im B√ºro genauso anziehen wie im Garten.Allerdings stehen die Schuhe dadurch auch mal drau√üen. Nach dem ersten Sommer waren sie dann zwei Nummern kleiner - unfassbar wie sehr sie eingegangen sind. Mir ist klar, dass man die Schuhe nicht einem st√§ndigen Sonnenlicht und W√§rme aussetzten sollte, aber auf der anderen Seite sollten doch gerade die Marken-Crocs zumindest einen Sommer aushalten. Insofern keine klare Kaufempfehlung.

Ich wollte wenigstens mal den Fu√ü reinstecken, um nach der Gr√∂sse zu gucken.

  They do come in large sizes such as 15 which is what I am but when it came it was way too loose. If you are going to buy this I would recommend that you get a size smaller then you are.

  I can't remember ordering these awful clogs, but somehow Amazon decided I should and sent them to me.  I have been trying to return them ever since with no success.  You can get similar clogs - the same clogs in fact - at a better price in virtually any shop that stocks this brand.  A total rip off, in my opinion.  They are horrid, far too large, etc etc etc.  I hate them.  Amazon, please come and take them away‚Ä¶  See the consumer credit act, trading standard laws, etc.  This is the UK.  You sent them, I told you I didn't want them, etc.  I am getting in touch with trading standards very soon.

  Gute Crocs  ""made in Italy"". Das Material ist etwas h√§rter als bei meinen Letzten ""made in bosnia"" aber trotzdem immer noch bequem.Korrektur 10.9.16 >>>>>Leider muss ich alle Sterne Streichen. Ich habe die Crocs ums Haus und im Garten ab und zu angehabt. Die meiste Zeit aber standen sie umher. (teilweise in der Sonne). Das hat Ihnen nicht gut getan. Sie haben sich verformt und sind inzwischen (3-4 Wochen) fast 2 Gr√∂ssen kleiner geworden.Meine Alten habe ich 3-4 Jahre gehabt und die waren einfach abgen√ºtzt aber Form und Gr√∂sse war immer noch OK.Meine erste Empfehlung nehme ich zur√ºck ,denn ""Schrumpfschuhe"" m√∂chte bestimmt niemand.Die Bilder zeigen wie die hier beschriebenen Crocs nach kurzem Gebrauch aussehen. Mit dem blauen guten Schuh,den ich vor ein paar Jahren gekauft habe, ist gut sichtbar wieviel kleiner der neue geworden ist.

  Die schwarzen Crocs passen, wie erwartet, gut, allerdings hatten  sie anfangs einen penetranten Plastikgeruch, der auch jetzt nach einer Woche noch nicht ganz weg ist. Vielleicht h√§ngt dies mit der Schwarzf√§rbung zusammen oder mit der Tatsache, dass sie in China gefertigt wurden.

  I bought the exact same pair a few years ago and love it, so I bought this one only to find it's 1.5cm smaller in length, width and height although they're both marked as the same size!!It's extremely disappointing to find out the Crocs brand is SO inconsistent with its sizing that ordering the exact same pair in the exact same size can make you end up with a whole size less.

  Well I should have taken more note of the other reviews! I have bought  many pairs of crocs for family members over the last two years but noted the comment about the change in sizing so ordered as advised - when the came they were much  much smaller than the the same sized Crocs bought a year ago; those were made in China the latest were made in Italy. Another reviewer expressed frustration that a company like Crocs cant get its suppliers to produce to a consistent size standard and I agree. You might as well buy locally - there are plenty of Croc lookalikes to choose from at a much lower price and they might not last as long but at least you know they fit

Das Material ist ein vollkommen anderes, als die Crocs aus Italien (habe alle meine durchgesehen und meine sind alle aus Italien und super!). Aber diese hier...nein Danke! Wie kann eine Firma wie Crocs nicht ""mitkriegen"", dass diese China-Crocs Vollschrott sind??? Sind viel h√§rter als die Anderen, stinken und haben seltsame ""Muster"" und sind nicht glatt wie die ""richtigen"". So kann man sich auch Kunden vergraulen! Ich werde jedenfalls keine Crocs aus China f√ºr teures Geld kaufen-dann wars das halt mit den neuen Crocs bei mir. Aber solch eine miese Qualit√§t k√∂nnen die behalten. Bin ma√ülos entt√§uscht von diesen Schuhen!P.S. stellt die Schuhe mal in die Sonne...auch ein sehr ""nette"" Erfahrung-die gehen n√§mlich ein!!!

Einziges Manko sind glatte feuchte Fl√§chen, daf√ºr hat das Material nicht den n√∂tigen Grip.Update 07.10.2014Ich muss meine Meinung √§ndern !Heute kam ein von mir bestellter Schuh an, in Form und Ausf√ºhrung der selbe Schuh wie anfang 2013 bestellt hatte und aktuell auch trage ! Der heutige gelieferte Schuh ist um 20 mm kleiner ! Insgesamt viel zu knapp ! Entspricht nicht der Gr√∂√üe, obwohl es nach Datenblatt und Einpressung mittig der Sohle der selbe Schuh ist ! Und das direkt bei Crocs √ºber Amazon bestellt ! Beide made in Italien !

  Es ist kaum m√∂glich, etwas Positives √ºber Crocs zu √§u√üern. Hatte mir mehrere verschiedene Modelle bestellt und auch in L√§den mal anprobiert. Kaum ein Schuh passt, weil die Gr√∂√üen keiner Norm entsprechen und sogar innerhalb eines Modells die Schuhe unterschiedlich gro√ü ausfallen. Das h√§ngt wohl damit zusammen, ob der Schuh in Asien oder Europa hergestellt worden ist (wird tats√§chlich in mehreren L√§ndern produziert, wobei die Italiener die besseren Schuhe herstellen). Manchmal miefen die Plastik-Clogs, jedenfalls die in Asien produzierten. Tragekomfort konnte ich nich feststellen. Das 41er Modell dr√ºckte an den Zehen, dass 42er schlappte, im geheizten Zimmer schwitze der Fuss in dem Plastik (trotz Bel√ºftungsl√∂chern). 2 Zehner zahlt man f√ºr den Namen, bestimmt nicht f√ºr Verarbeitung und so ein billiges Material.

  Eigentlich finde ich Crocs h√§sslich, habe mir aber aus lauter Verzweiflung welche bei einem New York-Urlaub gekauft, um die Fu√üm√§rsche durch die Stadt bei 40 Grad blasenfrei zu √ºberstehen. Seitdem bin ich Fan. Mein Kater leider auch und deshalb war es an der Zeit, die zerbissenen Latschen durch Neue zu ersetzen. Das war nicht so einfach, denn die Gr√∂√üen S,M, L usw stimmen nicht mit den europ√§ischen √ºberein. Au√üerdem waren die Schuhe Made in Mexico viel weicher und bequemer als die hier Made in Italy. Die Noppen im Fu√übett sind ganz sch√∂n hart. Was mich aber richtig nervt, ist, dass die Lasche nicht oben auf dem Schuh h√§lt, sie rutscht immer zur√ºck. Mein Kater macht √ºbrigens keinen Unterschied, er bei√üt auch in diesen Croc herzhaft rein....

But the Crocs would have been just what I wanted. I sent them back and stated I wanted a uk8, and got the same as the ones I had all ready sent back, so I now had another pair to return. I would have giving a 5 star but the mix up with the size I will give them a 3 star as the returns were very easy. Hopefully my money will be return as easy as the returns

  I suffer from plantar fasciatis in both heels and was recommended these crocs by a friend who had suffered from the same ailment and got great relief from this type of shoe.  Within half an hour of putting them on I was in complete agony and spent several hours afterwards off my feet as I was unable to even hobble, never mind walk.  Needless to say I was very disappointed as I expected to be able to walk easier and relatively pain free once I wore them.  However, they did arrive in excellent time and were comfortable once I put them on, shoe size, width etc. was spot on.  My problems only began once I actually started to walk in them.  Perhaps this type of shoe helps mild plantar fascitis but it is definitely not good for the more debilitating type.  I would recommend these shoes only for people who do not suffer from pain in their feet.

  Ich muss hier vorweg sagen das ich nur mal eine 5-Euro-Kopie der Schuhe hatte und diese nach 6 Monaten weggeworfen habe. Soweit so gut und hab mir hier die Originalen bestellt nachdem ich mich wegen den Gr√∂√üen erkundigt hatte.Mir sind Schuhe in 44 immer passend wenn nicht sogar ein wenig zu gro√ü und hatte hier 44/45 bestellt. Nach meinem Empfinden sind diese 43-43,5 in deutscher Gr√∂√üe. Zum Sitzen geeignet aber mehr nicht. Bin sehr leicht vorne angesto√üen bzw. es hat gedr√ºckt. Also Versandkosten zahlen und zur√ºck. Hier direkt ein Tipp: aufpassen bei WEM man bestellt! Hatte bei einem H√§ndler die Schuhe bezogen und dieser hatte keinen kostenlosen R√ºckversand. Au√üerdem waren die Schuhe in keiner anderen Gr√∂√üe mehr vorhanden. Gibt bei Amazon √∂fters mal kostenlosen R√ºckversand oder ihr bestellt euch direkt 2 Gr√∂√üen und eine geht retour. Als Anhaltspunkt k√∂nnt ihr nehmen 26cm Fu√ül√§nge ist 44/45, alles was dr√ºber ist gr√∂√üer bestellen.Hab mir die Crocs nochmal in 45/46 bestellt und bin gespannt ob diese passen (war im Schuhladen testen :))Ach ja da hier immer wieder mal das Produktionsland erw√§hnt wird, meine waren aus Mexiko und hatten den ganz normalen Geruch von neuen Plastikschuhen. Ist eben kein Leder und das sollte man immer ber√ºcksichtigen.

  Size is somewhat large. I had ordered for M12 as per chart : but is loose on length and width. The rear strap doesn't help much.However recently I ordered crocs flip flop of M12 size which fitted me perfectly. This Anomaly is confusing, particularly for online purchases.When I tried for return / cancellation option, the refund is limited to basic cost (Rs. 1764/- in this case) and balance Rs. 1300/- towards import / freight is to be absorbed by customers - which is a unfair burden.On screen the price indicated is Rs.1764/- but when you place order the cost comes to Rs. 3056/- which should be indicated initially. Overall you feel let down on a good product - first time Buyer need to be vey careful about size unless you have tried with friend or acquaintance and are very sure.To avoid hassles of import / refund you may buy online from shopcrocs.in - you wont have to take a financial hit.

  Leider musste ich feststellen, dass diese nicht gerade billigen Schuhe eine absonderliche Eigenschaft besitzen: Sie schrumpfen, wenn man sie in der Sonne oder in der Tageshitze drau√üen stehen l√§sst - nicht eine, nicht zwei, auch nicht drei, sondern bis zu vier Nummern.Meine Frau hat der ganzen Familie Crocs bestellt, mir selbst welche in Gr√∂√üe 42-43. Gedacht waren sie als Gartenschuhe oder f√ºrs Freibad, jedenfalls f√ºr drau√üen, was mir als Verwendungszweck nicht ganz abwegig erscheint. Doch nach einigen Tagen, an denen es recht hei√ü war, glaubte ich, die Schuhe verwechselt zu haben und die meines √§lteren Sohnes angezogen zu haben.Allerdings hatte die nun mein j√ºngerer Sohn an, weil seine nahezu auf Puppengr√∂√üe geschrumpft und sich bananenartig gebogen hatten. Das gleiche Ph√§nomen zeigte sich bei den Schuhen meiner Frau und meines gr√∂√üeren Sohnes.Nach l√§ngerem Gr√ºbeln kam ich zu dem Schluss, dass wohl alle Schuhe geschrumpft sein mussten und bei Nachforschungen im Internet durfte ich feststellen, nicht allein mit diesem Problem zu sein.CROCS schrumpfen bei Hitze in der Sonne, jedenfalls diejenigen, die wir erhalten haben - und auch diejenigen anderer.Dies sind die ersten Schuhe, bei denen mir Derartiges passiert ist.Meine Schuhe mit Gr√∂√üe 42-43 passen nun nicht mal mehr meiner Frau mit Schuhgr√∂√üe 39.Diese Schuhe sind zum Wegwerfen.Ich werde mir jedenfalls keine mehr kaufen und kann sie gewiss niemandem empfehlen, da es auch kein vereinzelter Vorfall ist, wie jeder nachgoogeln kann.

  Y es por el precio y por el aparente ""√©xito"" de dicho calzado que me decid√≠ a probarlas.Primeramente quer√≠a decir que la talla es de broma. Pido unas 39/40 alarmado por los comentarios de otros compradores y a√∫n as√≠ me sobra zapato. Es grande...Despu√©s de investigar un poco sobre las crocs he llegado a la conclusi√≥n de que no son un zapato de calle. Buscad y leed que pueden ocasionar problemas musculares si andais mucho con ellas. O que la etiqueta que traen y que advierte de tener precauci√≥n en las escaleras mec√°nicas es porque ya ha habido gente lesion√°ndose con ellas... algunas muy gore....Para mi suerte, yo buscaba hacerles un uso 100% dentro de casa como zapatillas de estar por casa.Y CUMPLEN porque:1 Amortiguan muy bien la pisada y tienen una zona de masaje por todo el pie (si hace algo o no, ni idea, pero ah√≠ est√° y se nota).2 De momento no cogen olores raros (salvo su pl√°stico caracter√≠stico)3 Son c√≥modos y protegen el pie de golpes contra picos y patas de los muebles (al ser goma (o lo que sea) no notas dolor al impactar accidentalmente en cosas)4 Son antideslizantes SIIIII y da igual si pisas lo fregado que no deslizas. Pero ojo, que la bronca de tu pareja / padres por pisarles lo recien fregado no te la quita nadie.De todas formas y desde un punto de vista pr√°cticos tienen DEFECTOS....1) 42 euros.... estamos locos? que es un pol√≠mero (pl√°stico) insertado en un molde y ya est√°.2) El pie suda... Yo me pongo calcetines para no sentir tanto el tacto directo y a√∫n as√≠ las zonas con mucho contacto con el material sin agujeros suda y el calcet√≠n puessss algo si que se nota h√∫medo.3) Se rozan facilmente y pierden material de la suela (que se desgastan r√°pido, vamos).Mi conclusi√≥n es que puede que repita (a precios amazon) este calzado PARA USARLO POR CASA. O incluso entiendo gente que est√° mucho tiempo de pie y las usen para trabajar pues son c√≥modos y el pie respira m√°s que con otro calzado cerrado.PERO NO ES UN CALZADO DE CALLE... da problemas musculares, se desgastan r√°pido y es antiest√©tico.

  Leider ist bei diesen Crocs in der Farbe Braun tats√§chlich das wahr geworden, was schon mehrere K√§ufer in ihren Rezensionen berichtet haben: die Crocs sind in der Sonne geschrumpft.Gekauft im April haben sie nun gut 3 1/2 Monate im Freien auf der s√ºdseitigen Terrasse verbracht und auch gute Dienste beim Rasenm√§hen, Badmintonspielen und im Gem√ºsegarten getan. Nun sind sie von Gr√∂√üe 40 auf ca Gr√∂√üe 38 eingegangen - nun passen sie nicht mehr meiner Mutter, sondern meiner 14-j√§hrigen Nachbarin :)Gerade an der Fersenpartie sind sie erheblich schm√§ler geworden, aber auch in der L√§nge geschrumpft.Ansonsten waren die Crocs vom Tragegef√ºhl und von der Haltbarkeit bisher sehr gut, auch der Preis mit gut 16 ‚Ç¨ war sehr g√ºnstig. Aufgrund des Schrumpfens aber, vor allem schon nach so kurzer Zeit, gibt es von mir leider nur zwei Sterne, da sie von meiner Mutter so nicht mehr getragen werden k√∂nnen.Eine gute Alternative zu diesem Modell haben wir allerdings schon gefunden:¬†

L'ho restituito e successivamente mi sono preso un 43/44 che comunque risulta ancora leggermente troppo largo/lungo...probabilmente la misura ideale per me sarebbe il 43 che per√≤ non esiste, magari prover√≤ in futuro a prendere un 42/43 per vedere coma va.Ad ogni modo, nonostante questo le ciabatte sono piuttosto comode.Come ultima nota il fatto che nonostante le Crocs arrivate fossero made in Italy, la plastica emanava un fortissimo odore.

Ich lie√ü sie, wie man es mit Gartenschuhen so macht, auf der Terrasse stehen.Nach einem hei√üen Tag schl√ºpfte ich abends in die Schuhe und kam nicht mehr hinein. Zuerst dachte ich, es hat mir jemand einen Streich gespielt oder vielleicht die Schuhe verwechselt. aber ich las dann auf der Website des Herstellers nach, dass die Schuhe tats√§chlich in der Hitze schrumpfen k√∂nnen, und zwar um mehrere Schuhgr√∂√üen.So toll die Schuhe am Anfang waren, ich w√ºrde sie deswegen nicht mehr kaufen.

  Not sure if Crocs has changed something with their sizing, but I already owned a pair and ordered based on the size moulded on the bottom (in the same same style) but the pair Amazon sent was much much smaller.

  Leider ist es bei Crocs Gl√ºckssache, ob man die Ware aus China, Italien, Vietnam, Mexico oder sonstwo her bekommt.

Ich hatte einen sehr schmerzhaften Fersensporn. Jetzt sp√ºre ich gar nichts mehr. Das jetzt bestellte Paar, gleiches Produkt, ist zum einen zu klein und zum anderen aber auch eine ganz andere, leider schlechtere Qualit√§t. Das Material ist h√§rter und macht nicht den Eindruck, dass es lange durchhalten wird. Die werde ich zur√ºck schicken.

  Da kauft man extra ""echte"" crocs,weil man hofft, das es eine gute Qualit√§t ist und wird nach ein paar Wochen eines besseren belehrt! Zum einen haben die crocs total stark nach ""Chemie/Gummi/Plastik"" gerochen, was schon unangenehm war. Und zum anderen stehen die crocs bei Wind u Wetter auf der Terasse und sind tats√§chlich bei starker Sonnenhitze ""eingelaufen"", d. h. der gesamte Schuh hat sich zusammengezogen, so das er nun nicht mehr der angegebenen Gr√∂√üe entspricht. So etwas habe  ich noch nicht erlebt! Wir haben ganzj√§hrig mehrere Crocs auf der Terasse stehen und bei keinem anderen Paar ist das passiert!

Obwohl ich meine √ºbliche Gr√∂√üe bestellt habe (M6/W8) passen sie nicht. Sind ca. 1cm kleiner als gewohnt. Auch das Material ist viel h√§rter, sehr unangenehm sogar. Sowohl die letzten Classic, als auch diese sind beide 'Made in Italy'.

  Da mein Freund seit vielen Jahren seine Crocs zu den unterschiedlichsten Aktivit√§ten und Jahreszeiten tr√§gt, habe ich mich schlie√ülich auch dazu entschieden - ein totaler Reinfall! Im Mai habe ich sie zum ersten Mal beim Ostseeurlaub (Fr√ºhlingswetter) getragen. Ich war geschockt, als ich am n√§chsten Tag feststellen musste, dass sich das Material komplett verzogen hatte und das Produkt wie geschrumpft erschien. Das Resultat waren unangenehme Druckstellen an den Fu√üinnenseiten und Zehen, da kein Platz mehr blieb. Sofort habe ich die Schuhe reklamiert und anstandslos ein neues Paar geschickt bekommen. Auf dem Foto ist der Unterschied ersichtlich: es ist dieselbe Gr√∂√üe! Ich hatte das Ersatzpaar nicht direkt gebraucht und erst k√ºrzlich verwendet, aber die Freude war von kurzer Dauer. Auch das Material des Ersatzpaares hat sich komplett verformt, ohne dass die Schuhe der prallen Sonne ausgesetzt waren.

  Very different quality from my old pair: the material is slippery on the inside and rigid, the mold seams have plastic residue hanging off. Came in a plastic bag with a completely unrelated safety label not even mentioning the Crocs, about safely travelling on escalators and moving walkways (?) Makes me wonder if the Crocs' quality just went way down or what is going on??? Is it even the original product? Not happy with the purchase!

  Worin unterscheiden sich Original Crocs von (billigeren) Nachahmungen? Fr√ºher h√§tte ich gesagt, in Hinsicht von Verarbeitung und vor allem in Hinsicht Formstabilit√§t sind die Originale den Nachahmungen haushoch √ºberlegen. Leider wurde ich nun eines Besseren belehrt. War es bei den ersten Modellen noch gar kein Problem, dass man die Schuhe einen Tag lang drau√üen in der Sonne stehen lie√ü folgt nun mittlerweile die gro√üe √úberraschung: Wie von Zauberhand verringert sich die Schuhgr√∂√üe (-breite) um ca. 4-5 Nummern. --> Schuhe kann man gleich in den M√ºll werfen. F√ºr mich wars das auf jeden Fall mit Crocs, ich werde mir sicher das Geld sparen und gleich zu den billigen Produkten greifen. Da wei√ü ich wenigstens, was mich erwartet.

Dieses Ph√§nomen tritt wohl gerne auf bei Schuhen ""Made in China"", wie ich in diversen Bewertungen nachlesen konnte.

  La talla no coincide, son un poco grandes. Tengo varias Crocs, todas de la talla 10, y estas a pesar de que pone talla 10, son muy grandes. No volver√© a comprar este producto en su web.

  Amazon Prime is amazing! You can get the wrong size delivered the very next day - not once, ladies and gentlemen, not twice, boys and girls, but THREE TIMES! I ordered size 10 and I keep receiving size 11. It's taken me 64 years for my feel to grow to size 10, I'm not sure how long they'll take to reach 11. I could stuff the packaging into these size 11 Crocs to pad them out a bit, I suppose. I've looked on Amazon for a pair of size 11 feet, but any search involving body parts is frowned upon, it seems. I'd like to review the product, they look fine, and I'm sure that if I ever received a pair that fitted they'd do the job nicely, but without a road test a review would be meaningless. So, back goes another pair. Which way is the High Street .......?

  Zuerst war alles prima. Die Lieferung war am n√§chsten Tag da, der Artikel gefiel und pa√üte gut. Der Schuh ist federleicht und tr√§gt sich angenehm.Am n√§chsten Tag stand er dann einen Nachmittag lang auf der Terrasse in der Sonne. Als ich abends wieder reinschl√ºpfen wollte kam die gro√üe √úberraschung. Ich kam gar nicht mehr in den Schuh hinein. Er mu√ü durch das Stehen in der Sonne geschrumpft sein. Mu√ü also ein sehr minderwertiger Kunststoff sein, denn sonst passiert das eigentlich nicht. Ich werde den Schuh erst einmal zur√ºckschicken und einen Ersatz kommen lassen. Vielleicht war es ja ein Montagsmodell. Wenn nicht - dann war das mein erster und letzet Crocs.

  Crocs sind praktische Hausschuhe, bequem, schnell an und auszuziehen, d√§mpfen die Schritte auf Parkett/Dielen, halten die F√º√üe warm ohne schwitzen (zumindest bei mir). Merkw√ºrdig jedoch, dass die Firma Crocs das mit den Gr√∂√üen nicht hinbekommt. Ich wollte mir neue Crocs gleicher Gr√∂√üe bestellen. Auf meinen alten Crocs stehen die Zahlen 10 und 12. Leider muss ich hier bei Amazon die Gr√º√üen in 43/44 etc. ausw√§hlen. Also auf die Crocs Homepage, um dort an Hand einer Gr√∂√üentabelle abzugleichen, welche Gr√∂√üe ich bestellen muss, um wieder ein Paar der Gr√∂√üe 10 und 12 zu erhalten. Aber Fehlanzeige, auch auf der Crocs Homepage ist nur von 43/44 etc. die Rede.Also mutig 43/44 bestellt und siehe da, es stehende Zahlen 10 und 12 auf der Unterseite der Crocs. Und trotzdem sind diese einen Tick kleiner, obwohl es sich bei beiden um die Classic handelt. Au√üerdem scheint das Material h√§rter, die Crocs d√§mpfen weniger, die Noppen im Fu√übett dr√ºcken beinahe unangenehm.

  These genuine Crocs were not a UK size 12 as advertised and as per the Crocs label.  I have been buying my Dad size 12 Crocs for years without any problem with the sizing.  His Crocs that fit have the number 12 on the sole.  These had a number 13 on the sole but the label clearly stated ""UK 12"".  They were too big.  My Dad has mobility issues and having shoes that fit is imperative to his being able to walk safely and confidently.  Unfortunately I could not return as I trusted the label which I had removed and had written my Dad's name on (he lives in a care-home).  This has put me off buying genuine Crocs on-line.

  This is the 3rd pair of Crocs I have bought online. Always same size, for my father and myself. However, this time, although the specs are exactly the same (as shown on the soles) the crocs are 2 cm shorter than previous pairs. We only noticed this fault when I gave the crocs as a gift to my dad, who lives overseas. It is frustrating and embarrassing. Also, it is very inconvenient to bring the crocs back to the UK, ship them back, etc. Very poor experience due to these nonsensical, inconsistent sizes. My advice: buy your Crocs in a normal retail store, as Amazon has proved unreliable in relation to sizes.

  Per qualche motivo [probabilmente economico] Crocs ha cambiato il disegno dell' interno delle scarpe. Io ho un paio di Crocs Classic Sabot che ho comprato 5 anni fa e sembrano imbottite in qualche modo. Sono morbide e molto comode. Pero' le suole sono consummate e quindi sono molto pericolose sul bagnato. Adesso invece le scarpe dentro sono dure e dopo poco tempo danno fastidio al piede. Sono diventate come qualsiasi altra imitazione delle Crocs che si trovano in giro per meno della meta'.

  Ich hatte ja bereits aus vorhergehenden Rezensionen erfahren, dass die Crocs ""Made in China"" extrem schlecht sind, ich kann das nur best√§tigen, die Schuhe stinken so extrem, dass ich sie nicht tragen m√∂chte, sie gehen sofort zur√ºck - Schade!!! Da leider beim Einkauf nicht angegeben ist, ob aus Italien oder China und meine Vorbesteller mal so mal so bekommen haben, habe ich es einfach mal versucht - und Pech gehabt. Liebes Amazon-Team, wenn ihr das lest, bitte verkauft keine Made in China Crocs mehr. Ihr spart euch jede Menge Retouren dadurch.
