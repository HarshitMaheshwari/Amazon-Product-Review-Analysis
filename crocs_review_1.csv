Long Lover of Crocs. Don't worry about sizes for UK Buyers
",World of Wayne,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Just bought these for the Mrs. She is a size 6 so I got Men UK 5 / Women UK 6 and they fit perfectly. The last pair of Crocs I bought lasted 7 years so these are made to last. Brilliant and comfortable for the forthcoming summer days.

Confusing sizes!! Womans are affected also!! Buy size larger!!
",caroline,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These crocs are really soft , flexible and so comfy! My only problem was with the size! And can I say that it's NOT JUST  mens sizes which need altering it's women's too!! I'm always a size 4 yet on the soles of these it has UK sizes but says 'M3 / W4'....which totally confused me, so I ordered 2 pairs and the 2nd pair says UK sizes 'M4/W5' which still confuses me!! (How can a man's size be a 3 and the same shoe for a woman size 4? OR Man's size 4 and woman's size 5?) Anyway moving on. ...the upshot of all this was the M3/W4 were small (felt more like a size 3!) and the M4/W5 were just right (felt like a size 4!) So... FOR WOMEN pick a size BIGGER!!

Pot Luck
",Cake Lady,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I'm a size 6 and have worn crocs for years as ladies size 6 and my feet measurement on the chart says size 6. Ordered a new pair in Candy Pink, but they were way to small. My toes were sticking out of the holes at the front, they had been made in Mexico, whereas previously we've had them from China, Italy and Bosnia. At best they could have passed for a 4 1/2. They were returned and I ordered the next size (7). These were made in Italy and whilst being a bit big, I've kept them as it seems to be pot luck on where they are made. Crocs really need to sort out this sizing lark once and for all.

What is wrong with these sizes?!?
",Uncle Lol,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Pros: They're comfy, they're washable, they don't make your feet sweat, they come in lots of colours, the price-tag of £20 was great value.Cons: YOU REALLY DO NEED A SIZE SMALLER THAN ADVERTISED!As other reviewers have stated, the sizing seems to differ from one country of manufacture to another. The first pair I ordered, before returning, were made in Romania. These were large enough to accommodate both feet in one shoe (if I'd have wanted to). The second pair, this time made in Vietnam, were a good fit. Note, I said ""good fit""; if anything, I thought they were ever-so-slightly too-small but I've decided to keep them as they don't feel uncomfortable & should stay on my feet. I'm talking about bare feet. Not thick socks. Worn for the pool & beach. Not for gardening in all weathers. What is WRONG with you?

Great shoes for beach and garden!
",emlep,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I use a pair of crocs for beach walks (no fear of getting them wet and the sand slips through the holes!) and walking around the garden- so they are very useful. Plastic burns my feet but this material doesn’t.  I had a pair but my dog took one and I couldn’t find it anywhere. So I bought these. And guess what- my dog brought back the missing croc! So I have a pair for the beach and a pair for the garden. Excellent. I’m a 37/UK 4 and find this size (36 US 6) a tiny bit small if I use the strap on my heel (useful for walking up the garden slopes) but next size up would be too big.

Pomegranate Crocs! What's not to like!
",C. Hawkes,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  OK, first off I am a Croc fan. I've even been to the Croc Shop in Vegas!And these Classic Crocs are great. Same Croc comfort, same Croc design - and a great new colour.A couple of things. The product heading says ""Women's Classic Crocs"" - actually, they are unisex.They are also ""relaxed"" fit - great for my wide feet.Size wise - Croc sizes can be confusing. I take a UK 81/2 size E.These are Men's UK size 9 - they are stamped on the sole M10 - American size.And they are a great, slightly loose (aka ""Roomy"") fit for me.If you have narrower feet, consider a Croc style which is badged ""Relaxed"" or, for narrow feet, ""Standard"" instead.

Not as good as the old style
",Cocohoney,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  They have changed the shape and feel of Classic Crocs which I think is a shame. I prefer the rounded wide front and squishiness of my old style crocs, these are considerably narrower at the front. I'm sure they have done this to try and make them less disagreeable to the anti-croccers, but actually they look more silly in their new slimline shape. They are also firmer- I preferred them soft.

Very comfortable
",katiecroc,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I think i may be in love with these shoes. I have a lot of pain issues with one of my feet and i would now live in these if i possibly could they are so comfy and well supported. I use these ones as slippers around the house. The only thing i find is that my feet can get a little sweaty in them if it is hot. However they are plastic shoes, this seems reasonable, and they do not cause the blisters that were such a problem with the old fashion plastic 'jelly' shoes. I ordered the size i am usually and these fitted perfectly. That you can shoes to have the back strap down of swing it forward to wear like a clog is also very good.

  I was really dubious about these as I was unsure on the size, but I checked out reviews and went with my usual shoe size (UK5 ladies) and they are perfect!They came in a plastic bag, but all of the relevant (authentic) labels and logos are present and correct.SO comfy and feel great.Very happy with the delivery time (Prime customer so 24 hours despite Covid-19) brilliant!Driver was really pleasant, kept within his social distance, had a mask on and I was really impressed.

Delightful Shoes - everyone loves them.
",JHM,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Delightful shoes. Comfortable, light, flexible, easy to wash - several times a day if necessary - easy to put on and take off - just excellent.This colour - yellow - is by far my favourite colour for Crocs.You simply would not believe the number of people - friends, acquaintances and total strangers - who have taken the trouble to stop and tell me how much they like my shoes, how cheerful they are, and how they made them smile.I might get another pair just in case these wear out one day - though my previous Crocs were bought 16 years ago, were worn more or less every day, and have still not worn out.

Expensive but quality
",emenjayell,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Much much better than the cheapo copies available on the High Street and with the added benefit of not having a pungent manufacturing smell. You only get what you pay, time will tell if the original lasts longer.  The purchasing process was complicated though. I ordered UK men's size 9 but at the checkout this had changed to size 8. Started again from scratch and same thing happened so was wondering what exactly would turn up and not happy at the prospect of having to break self-isolation to do a return. Thankfully this didn't happy but the supplier needs to sort out this anomaly.

He tried on for size today and I ended up buying him a size M7/L8 which is a size smaller!These Crocs are the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn, ideal for many occasions.In the summer I wear the Crocs Kadee style which are toe bar style, amazing!I hope this helps at least one person! 😘

Sizing issues
",Kel99,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I eventually swapped to Crocs Unisex-Adult's Classic Clogs, (Dusty Green), M 8/W 9 from a M 9/W 10 which I bought as I was told M9 meant Mens 9.  The M 8/W 9 is a UK LARGE men size 9 both in terms of length and width.  Although I'm normally Men 9.5 size, the 9 is a bit large which makes me wonder if I should have got an 8.  Also there is no Mens chart, no UK sizes displayed and no half sizes - all very confusing.

Sort out your sizing, Crocs!
",Countess Perpetua,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Others have commented on the strange sizing of Crocs, which seems to depend on whether they're made in Italy or China. I already had a pair of size 7s, which are roomy, so I only wear them round the house and garden.  And my son wears them (he's a size 9).  I needed something big to wear following a broken ankle so ordered a pair of black size 7.  They arrived and were visibly much smaller than the ones I already had. Small pair made in Italy, large pair made in China, both purporting to be size 7.  Really annoying.  I exchanged for a size 8 which is about the right size on my 'normal' foot - but I'm not usually an 8!Surely such a well known brand should be able to get its sizing right!

Crocs, nuff  said.
",Planetpeeps,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Crocs are, for me, functional footware. I only use them in the garden or when nipping out of the house for a very short while (to the recycling centre for example) when nice shoes would be pointless. They do all that I ask of them, the heel strap is useful when climbing ladders but they are mostly used without, allowing easy shedding when coming inside from a mucky job. They will not keep out moisture but can be hosed down when needed. I do not buy them for their comfort, they are NOT good walking shoes. I do however have at least two pairs in my possession at all times - one lined one not. It took many years to wear out my first pair. I shall hope these last as long.

Crocs are Crocs!
",Mrs P,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Having owned Crocs before, these were exactly what I expected. Bought as slippers for wearing in the house only. I wear with thick socks as the toe box is big and they are wide generally. Although shaped inside, there is relatively little arch support. Plastic is soft and maleable. I find the little bumps inside comfortable. In shoes I'm normally a 3 / 3.5 but smallest here was M4/W6 - a wee tad big but nothing major. Would still recommend.

Croc Convert (+ Size tip!)
",Cesc15,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Ok so I’m obsessed. How are these so comfortable?! Definitely converted to Crocs now. I got them to have something easy & waterproof to slip on to nip out the back garden, and let the dog out, etc. I could definitely live in these, they’re so comfortable.My tip for SIZE! This was the thing I was worried about because wow so much conflicting info, and sizes I’ve never seen before! The thing I did was to look at the size chart in this listing and literally measure my foot with a tape measure! This told me I was actually a 6 and not a 5 as I was expecting; and the clogs fit lovely. I am a 5 - 5.5 usually, never a 6, but it’s ok for these. So I’d advise that for fit

A Good exam question
",James,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  A man walks into a shoe shop. He is normally a size 8 UK or 42 EU, but Crocs sizing varies. Crocs are made in Vietnam, Mexico, Italy, and other countries. Crocs usually size big but sometimes might size small., depending on where they are made. The man likes a neat fit. Amazon, customers, 3rd-party sellers, and Crocs are all confused about sizing. Amazon sometimes list them incorrectly and send out the wrong size. Which size should our customer order?* * * * *So apart from the sizing chaos, I like Crocs. Recommended, if you can pass the exam question above.

",Cate Jones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE my Crocs!  I've developed arthritis in all the toes on my right foot, so it can be incredibly painful, but wearing  Crocs is like walking on a cushion, such a relief!  I've had much cheaper versions previously, but you definitely get what you pay for, they didn't last long before the soles wore so thin, I couldn't wear them outside.  I bought a second pair of Crocs for wearing around the house, plus 2 pairs for my husband, he's converted!  The service was excellent, will definitely be recommending them, they're amazing!

  I do like Crocs, How ever...The first pair I bought were too big! They were like boats on my feet. I did keep them though, for wearing in my garden . I read on a review about these shoes that at womens UK size 6 was a 7 ladies and a mens size 6. It was much too big for me.I have now bought the size down 38 /39. Which is also meant to fit a ladies size 6 UK size.  The new ones should be Ok, fingers crossed. As I have another pair I bought from some one else a few years ago. But sadly wasn't able to get to them ,to see the size when buying mine  from here.

Crocs - genuine and good quality
",Kate C,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Seem like genuine Crocs. Clompy, unfashionable but invaluable, either for camping or popping into the garden. Makes you realise how worn the old ones were as these have good grip both inside and on the sole! Genuine crocs have the advantage of bring both less slippy and having more durable straps. In the past, I have also taken them into Crocs shops when the kids' posts, holding the straps, have come out and been lost. In each case, these were replaced free of charge which is an exceptional service from Crocs.

  These Crocs are the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned. I have slightly wide feet and a touch of arthritis in my big toe so finding comfortable footwear is a constant struggle. I could wear these shoes all day I think. Also the colour is lovely - they're advertised as Brown (garnet), no idea why as they're not brown at all, just a lovely deep rich red.

American sizing!!
",Sally,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Although I ordered UK women's size 7, the crocs I got were US size 7 / 9 (women's / men's size) which would be a UK size 5 according to Amazons sizing info.  Luckily however I wanted these to wear in the garden and for decorating etc (at £16 they were ideal!) and with the heel strap forward they are a comfortable fit for such things.  I can wear the heel strap back for short periods but they do cramp my toes a little so I couldn't wear them for walking any distance.I am a UK size 6.5 and if I were buying crocs for walking I would, on the basis of these, buy an American size 8/10 - so in short I think if I had got the size I ordered ( American 9/11) they would have been too big!!As for the crocs - I don't think I would wear these (even in the right size) other than for working around the house but I've only had them a week so maybe they'll grow on me :). It's a styling thing really, i just don't think they are ""me"". But as a sturdy, comfortable shoe that I can wear while cleaning the pond or decorating, they are brilliant.

  Crocs are a product which you either love or hate.  My partner loves them as holiday footwear.Ideally you wear these without socks.  They will leave your feet dry and give you an added spotty foot!

  These were bought for my wife as a replacement to a cheaper variant and she is more than happy with them. With all new shoes you expect them to be a bit stiff on first wear and these are no different but then again the name speaks for itself.These were a ladies size 7 and they fit her feet perfectly. They are great for lounging about the house or in the garden. The sole has a decent grip for walking although I wouldn't advise walking for long distances in them as they are not a walking shoe. She can even drive wearing these as the little loop strap can be placed behind the heel or worn as a sandal when placed over the bridge of the foot.

  Croc's, dunno why they call 'em that, but hey their good. They don't smell their loose on your feet but still grip even if they are a size too big, but thats what all the other reviewers said, and i'm glad i took their advise to get one size bigger cos looser the better.They are so light on your feet you wouldn't know you got 'em on, they've got a patterned surface on the inside of the sole that feels a bit rough to start with bit after a time you get used to it and it kinda massages ya feet.Your feet do sweat a bit but with the holes all over the croc the air kinda cools ya feet.Yer they do look a bit ungainly like the typical clodhoppers of old and its a bit weird going out in 'em when you first get ya crocs, but take my word they are really comfortable. A mate of mine wore em when they first came out and they looked weird and he's a fashion guru, but i can see now why he wore em.Their made of some sort of hard polystyrene and the strap can either be used for the front for slip-ons or the the back to hold 'em on, even with the strap down to the shoe they don't flip off.Happy? yes well happy, for the price of 'em its good value and for comfort.

  The only complaint with this product is the sizing.

  Bought size advertised as M4/W5 as I am a UK 5. When they arrived, they are marked M5/W7. They only just fit me. Be careful when ordering as sizing is very confusing. Service prompt. Decided not to return as I can get away with this fit although it is much more snug then I expected

Versatile, airy and cushioned casual clog.  Very durable.  Excellent price.  3rd pair, would like more colours still.
",Kentish Reviewer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  My 3rd pair of crocks.  I've got joint problems in my back so I find the shock-absorbing abilities of these a real blessing !  Plus they have little bobbles in the inside so you get a small massage every time you put your foot down !The airvents are equally great for summer when you're doing a lot of walking round National Trust properties in the sunshine.  I also use them in the garden, round the house, for driving, the beach and when I want to wear comfortable shoes that don't have a heel or squish my feet up !!

Good value
",E. Vicke,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Really good crocks that are very dark blue, almost black. Crocs are generally well made and comfortable and this was no exception. They have a nice thick sole which makes it very pleasant to walk. I actually use them instead of slippers around the house.The only thing I would say is that they are moderately small although I have to say that I prefer really lose fitting crocs type shoes so it might be just down to my personal preference, rather than crocs making them on the smallish side.

Not a very generous fit
",C. JONES,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I usually buy Croc lookalikes (or mock crocs as I refer to them) from a well known high street shoe shop, but they seem to wear down on the heel quite quickly, so I thought I'd try the branded one's. I have wide feet, so purchase men's size 7 in the mock croc version. Other reviewers stated that sizing depended greatly on where their Crocs were made, but as I had no idea in advance which version I would receive, I thought I should stick with a size 7. I have to say mine are a little on the small side - not only narrower but also shorter in length. I wear them instead of slippers, so during the summer months they fit fine, but I cannot wear them with socks once it gets cooler - there simply isn't enough room in them. I think in future I will stick with the 2 pairs for £8.00 mock crocs, and just replace them more often. I find it rather ironic that a cheaper high street pair, is more generously sized than the expensive branded version.

Fabulous design footwear.
",B. Lengden,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  They're broader than I expected, but that's good as I like my big feet to look even bigger!  They're perfectly comfy, and I can easily slip them on and keep them on, whichever way I wear the strap; the 'pimply' footbeds are very well/anatomically designed.  I love the vivid green colour, and the Croc logo pics on the rivets holding the straps on.  I love that I can wear them indoors and out, and that they are very quickly and easily washable, and unharmed if I go outside in the wet.  I only wish I'd got some years ago!

Roomier fit than expected
",Branoic,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I wear Crocs around the house as indoor shoes and find them very comfortable. I always buy a size 8 (as I did with these) but these particular Crocs are a bit bigger than the other size 8 Crocs I own. The product label describes them as 'roomy fit', a style which I didn't know existed. I probably could have got away with buying a size 7 (if I'd known in advance how roomy these shoes are). These Crocs don't fit as nicely as my other size 8 Crocs but are still fine for wearing while wandering around the house. I'm reviewing them to mention that they are a larger fitting style just in case other shoppers would find the info useful.

  I bought these as a warehouse deal and they came through without branded packaging but appeared as brand new with tags.This is my second pair, bought the first several years ago, the soles wore thin and the straps detached, but i've kept them for garden use.Sure, they're kind of ugly but very practical. i use mine to cycle to the swimming pool ie can slip them on and off fast. And also to visit  a food gardening project where I need some protection from scratching etc and dont want to trash nice shoes, or wear heavy wellies in summerThey are very light to wear and comfy, with or without socks..The navy is a nice discreet colour.I would add that re sizing I am nearly always a 6/39, but take a 5 in crocs.

Funky item for holidays
",Scottie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These shoes were huge a few years ago although their popularity has waned dramatically.My partner and I spend a few weeks each year in Spain and do a lot of walking when we are there.  She tells me they are the most comfortable shoes she has ever worn long distances.  Due to the design, she lauds the fact that they are also the coolest shoes.  They are suitable for wear with or without socks (trainer socks - please!) and due to their rubber nature very easy to clean - just get a wet flannel and viola!These would suit the older generation on their winter escapes abroad - makes a big change from needing to find shoes that are watertight!Please note that each colour is a different price, and this can vary enormously.  For example an orange pair is currently £25 whereas the black £17.  Doesn't make sense to me!!!These can also be used as slippers.Well worth the money.

A long time fan of crocs!
",E. Foster,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I bought these crocs to wear as slippers, as I have done for many years. I finally got around to replacing my last pair, which had served me well for three years but the grips on the bottom were finally beginning to wear smooth. The colour is vibrant, and as always to fit is as expected and very comfortable. I have recommended to everyone I know, and now my parents and my father-in-law also wear them around the house instead of conventional slippers. Not only are they comfortable, but they are also supportive of the foot and have very good grips, which I have found to be invaluable on our steep staircase. No doubt I will wear these until there is no wear left in them and replace once again! Fantastic quality and this particular pair was a bargain.

Comfortable but too wide a fit

  Fits larger than expected, mainly for people with not so wide feet. I am normally a size 9, but I can fit easily into an 8 with room to spare. A smaller size than an 8 would mean it’s too short toe to heel. I wear this with scrubs, so it is fine for my purpose, but I wouldn’t like the fit, if I had to walk about for any reasonable distance.

The way that these Crocs are sized is just not working go back to the drawing board.

  I have purchased about ten pairs of these crocs over the last two years and by using the size chart provided.It's hit and miss whether you will get the right size to fit it's either too small or too big.On the very rare occasion, you will get a pair to fit me. So, as a result, I have about six pairs never worn because they are too big such a waste of money so I would be very reluctant to purchase another pair going forward.Don't get me wrong I love the comfort of Crocs but I'm not going to waste any more money it's just not worth it!!

UK size 9, Euro size 43 is my size and this is the size of Crocs I bought and ended up with but I'd say that they are more like a 10 if not 11... even with socks and having rather wide feet these things flopped about on my feet.Every other shoe I have ever had, from Ecco and Clarks to all makes of wellies I have always fitted a 9 or Euro 43, but not these.

Not fashionable but soo comfy

  I originally got a pair of these for work as they were practical and easily washed clean.  Loved them right from the start.  Then a couple of years ago my mum broke her foot and the only thing she could wear was my 'butt ugly horrible things' as she used to call them.  So suddenly these were acceptable to wear and I lost mine for a while so she could move around comfortably.  I ordered another pair for myself and a pair for her and we have both worn them ever since.Then a couple of weeks back, my dad has a pain in his heal and the only shoe which was comfortable to wear was my mum's crocs but then she was suffering without hers, so again back to amazon for another pair!!  I have had to order some jobbitz (sparkly of course) for my mum's crocs so they know which ones are which!!Be warned though, they shrink if left in the heat for long periods of time.  I forgot about my old pair and left them in my hot car for 8hrs, when I went to put them on for work, I found I couldn't get my feet in them as they had shrunk.  So that pair went off to my sister who has tiny feet!So from having a family who originally took the mick out of me for wearing crocs to work are now suddenly the family who all live in their crocs!!Am signed up to Amazon Prime and service was great, ordered them late on Saturday and received them Monday lunchtime.

  What can be said about crocs? They are incredibly comfortable and hard wearing. I get very sore balls of my feet when wearing any shoe, even those with a special insole in to support the metatarsal bones. However, with crocs, there is NO pain, ever. I live in crocs, indoors and outdoors. They are good on long walks. The downsodes? In winter, indoors my feet get a little cold, they're not as warm as slippers. They are slippy on ice. As the soles wear down, they get slippy on wet surfaces. Mine last about a year until the soles are very smooth but I still continue to wear them, just not on wet surfaces.They are easy to get on and using the strap, easty to keep on.Unlike cheap copies, the croc size matches my foot size perfectly.I now have loads of pairs of crocs and don't know what I would do if they stopped making them. I can't recommend these highly enough.

  Whilst decent enough quality, I find the sizing a little strange. I am nowhere near a size 10 in normal shoes, but as others have found out, Crocs sizing bears only a passing semblance to regular shoes.These size 9 crocs are about the equivalent of a regular shoe size 8 1/2.I can't wear them with the back strap on, I have to wear them with the strap folded forward, out of the way, to stop my toes pushing against the front.Live and learn, next time I'll buy a size larger than my regular shoe size. :/

Best purchase ever
",HM,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I bought these crocs around a month ago for a two week holiday in Florida where I knew it was going to be hot, I was going to be walking a lot and for many hours at a time - theme park visiting, sightseeing, etc.Absolutely all shoes pretty much hurt my feet - from high heels to low heels, from sandals to flip flop or even trainers end up hurting me if I wear them for too long. Not these crocs!!! I wore them consistently, pretty much every day for ten days. My feet didn't sweat, which I thought would be an issue, and I didn't get any marks, blisters or wounds. They are so comfortable they will be indispensable in all my future holidays. Granted, you feel like you are walking around in your slippers (how cool is that??)and the design may not go with all your clothes, but if the alternative is to be in fashionable pain, who cares?Just one thing, though - Bijou Blue is slightly darker than I thought it would be, but still a nice colour. Mine are made in Italy and size 5 UK is perfect for me (I am a size 5 in the UK, 38 or 38 and a half in Spain). Only mentioning this because the sizes confused me a little :)

  These are very similar if not identical to almost all Crocs purchased in the past. They share the same large dimples across the inner sole and heel and a intermittent pattern to the outer sole and heel.The fit is true to size unlike those made in China which are about half a size undersize, hence the suggestion to buy a size larger than normal. The sole pattern is an all-over herringbone pattern and there is no separation between sole and heel.I normally get 18-24 months of wear from a pair, wearing them several hours a day 24/7.

Good but a bit nobbly!
",G. Lucas,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I bought these in my usual size 7 but had to return them as they were too small. I ordered an 8 and they seem ok. I got them as a second pair to the comfy cheap imitation Crocs which I have worn to death and I thought I would treat myself to a pair of originals to see what all the fuss is about :) My only crit would be that they they are very nobbly under foot. I am wondering if this is supposed to stimulate circulation or something but I find it a bit irritating - I hope the pimpley nobles wear down as they make walking uncomfortable - perhaps someone could comment about that? Otherwise looking forward to using them to and from the hot tub on hols.

Bent straps
",Yasmin,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  This is unfortunately the second pair I have ordered from this seller. First paid had bent straps which did not sit correctly at the front of the crocs. This replacement pair has the same issue but even worse than the previous one. The crocs seem to have been put under some form of pressure maybe in the warehouse and therefore they have deformed shape. I will be returning this pair since I have seen a functional pair I know that the straps are not meant to be like this.

  I have previously purchased two black pairs of crocs from you the same size, they were made in Italy the newly purchased ones were made in China.  They are not as soft and the strap is longer.  I am not sure if the description said where they were made but it's something I will watch in future.  I use them for camping, in the garden and slippers hence three pairs.  They are ok but not as comfortable as the other two identical pairs.

Our people's crocks!
",Dr Mike,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Well, my new crocks are deepest red and they are great. And unlike the ones I recently bought in a local shop that were made in China, these produced in Italy! Some of my relatives tease me that these look more pink than red, but my wife assures me otherwise. A great buy and much cheaper than the Chinese ones. So comfortable, a pleasure to wear. But a word of advice - might be best to test them out in a local shop so that you get the right size. The trick is to make sure they are spacious and that the heel strap clings well. I was a bit doubting at first but they do and are so comfortable on the feet.

  This is my second pair now and this pair is different. My 1st pair were made in China and were great but have worn considerably on the sole in just under a year: about a month of outside wear and the rest inside; but no complaints as I do walk a lot of miles. My new  pair are made in Italy and fit slightly snugger {but more of a perfect fit). The material seems to be a better quality and I imagine will wear better than the Chinese...but of course time will tell.They are really good value and incredibly comfortable; perfect for indoors or for outside use.

",Monty,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have had an exact pair of crocs previously so I know they are brilliant.  BE WARNED though, they do come slightly larger than your normal shoe size.  I usually wear size 8 but after trying my first pair on in a shop, I only needed a size 7.I get Planta Faciatis (very painful feet after standing/walking for too long) and crocs are the only shoes I have found to alleviate this.  They seem to be the perfect shape and cushioning for supporting your arches and heels.  I live in them and worn my old ones out (just keep for in the garden now) so I would definitely recommend.

Sizes are wrong and not made in Italy like the picture
",karen,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Product pictures show 'made in Italy' but the green ones I ordered were made in Vietnam!. I ordered a UK 10 (US11) and the paperwork says that too but the product has 11 on them and they are too big and too wide .Clearly the different countries are making to different specifications. The US sizing crocs I normally buy which are made in Italy show 2 sizes on the base(as per picture on the description of the product). The Vietnam ones  have one size on the base. Amazon should either buy all their crocs in from the same supplier (yes I bought direct from Amazon not the marketplace) so they are all the the same size. This was a gift so its very disappointing to have to return them. Gave 1 star as the delivery service was good.

  I never thought I'd own a pair of Crocs, in fact I swore I wouldn't because they're ugly as sin!! But I dog sit in other peoples homes fairly often and got fed up of standing in hair and drool all the time. These plasticy 'clogs' are just awesome - i can just slip them on and trot around the house quite merrily! They don't slip off easily like flip flops can - especially when you use the bar thingy and they are VERY comfortable. I bought the black pair so as they didnt stand out too much - and I have to say (In the right situation) I have been converted - they're actually not as ugly as I thought!!

Crocs are as good as ever, but why do sellers make it so difficult to order the right size?
",Keith P.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I've been wearing Classis Crocs for years. It's a comfort thing, and it's a versatiltiy thing: they're great for round the house, but they also work for long-haul flights, and even long haul walking over rought ground. I'm just back from an extended trip to New Zealand, with lots of walking, beach-bashing and even 4-day canoe expeditions: I hardly wore anything but my Crocs in 6 weeks, resorting to boots only on the highest mountain Ruapehu, a 9,100 foot volcano.But whenever I buy a new pair (you do waer them out eventually with that kind of treatment) I have to play a guessing game. The sellers insist on me ordering them in a UK size, then they guess whether I want the US size slightly bigger or slightly smaller, and I've noe idea which way they will jump, so half the time I have to send them back. PLEASE can I have the option to order the US size I actually want ... I do know ... it's written on the sole of the ones I'm wearing. Believe me, I know other people who have the same problem over and again, and at least one who is giving up on Crocs, despite the comfort, because they're fed up with the lousy internet site that forces this silly guessing game. Come on Crocs ... get a web designed with a little bit of common sense and put your current web team out to grass (wearing wellies).

They can be washed and dried in a couple of minutes so are ideal for gardening, walking on the beach etc. I am using them as slippers around the house and notice that my legs tire less quickly than when wearing normal slippers.

  Got these for going on holiday, and have always wanted to try Crocs, as heard they're quite comfortable.They are excellent - really comfortable on bare feet, and keeps them nice and cool in warm environment.Only slight downside is that the 11 seemed a little bit too big - I'm a fairly exact size 11 with any other brand of shoe, and these felt a bit loose - not really a big deal, as the strap at the back holds the shoe on nicely.

  I finally succumbed to buying some Crocs after years of the in-laws saying how great they are. I bought them to go camping in France for wearing around the campsite/tent, slipping on for late night trips to the toilet, and generally ambling about. They are perfect for all these things. They are easy to slip on and off, they keep your feet surprisingly warm and they are comfortable straight out of the box. I would not wear them for long walks.Be warned: they should not be used for a fashion statement and they should not be decorated with little Croc trinkets.

  I was slightly disappointed by these. The insoles did not feel as comfortable or supportive as I'd hoped, and the size of the shoe was almost too short for my feet- it felt like my heel was hanging off the end of the shoe. However, width-wise, they felt too loose around my foot and wouldn't stay on unless I used the strap, which then pushed my foot forwards and squashed my toes. I wanted to use these as shoes/slippers to jump in and out of around the house, therefore they are no good for me and I will be returning them.

  Sizing is a bit weird.  I'm a UK women's 6 and I ordered these in a UK 9 and they are perfect.

Shame there is such a stigma with wearing these as I think they are great and comfortable as well.

genuine Crocs. Navy adult size 5
",wendy nutland,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have worn crocs for caravaning and at home for 5 years, they are comfy without socks and easy to slip on and off. I bought these for my son to wear in the same way. they are brilliant value for money. I do not think as them as a substitute for shoes but unlike the cheaper inferior ones do not harm your feet. When worn the heat from your feet moulds crocs to be a comfortable and good supportive fit, you can wear them on the beach as the holes allow any water to drain. Hence why the boating, caravanning and nurses have worn them for years.

wrong size
",Parents in Touch,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Gave these to my mother as a gift - bought at the same time as another pair for me which are perfectly sized. She has only just told me (as she didn't want to offend me) that she can't wear them as they are too small. On comparing them, although both pairs are marked Size 5, this pair is at least 2 sizes smaller and therefore unusable. Most disappointing as it's now too late to do anything about it.

Confusion with sizes

  Ordered size UK7. When arrived, package said UK8 and sole said US8. After two replacements found I out that in 2015 Crocs changed size classifications and US8 on sole is equivalent to UK7. There is obviously an error on package label. These are genuine Crocs and exceptional value for money. Just be aware, as in other reviews, of size classifications.

  I bought these Crocs because my original pair were beginning to look quite worn after 3 years of stirling service. I was delighted with the prompt service and with my new pair of Crocs. They are a lovely colour and a very good price, much cheaper than the original pair. The quality is excellent although the fabric seems to be a little less flexible and not quite as soft as my previous crocs. However, they look great and I would highly recommend them, I'm already considering another pair... there are so many delicious colours to choose from!

  Absolutely love these! I was another sniffy person about Crocs...certainly never thought they would be for me but they are just like walking on air, well made and incredibly comfortable.  Delivery was very quick and the colour is exactly as shown.  Reason for 4 stars is that, as others have commented, they are a tad small in my usual size 6.  A 7 I suspect would be too big.  They don't rub or hurt in anyway and I wear them all the time but I'm a bit aware that my big toe is right up against the top of the shoe, half size up would be perfect.

  A friend gave me a pair of crocs a while ago to try as I have a cut on my foot that won't heal and causes great pain when I walk on it, I tried them and was amazed, the pain disappears as soon as i put them on, I suffer from bunion pain and crocs also combat this and offer great relief.  I also put these on as soon as I get out of bed as previously I was unable to stand correctly on my right foot due to the pain it causes, as soon as I slip on my crocs the pain goes and I have no problem walking.  Would recommend these to anyone who has foot problems as they mould to your feet and offer instant relief.  I now have four pairs. They may not be the nicest looking shoe in the world but right now my comfort comes first!!

Not genuine Crocs
",Tesni Southwell,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are not genuine Crocs. After ordering these I decided to pay the £10 extra and order from the official Crocs website and whilst they look almost identical, these ones are a harder, plastic-style material whereas the genuine Crocs are more malleable and rubbery (and therefore higher quality). I'm sure these are fine but it's definitely worth spending slightly more for the real thing.

  I bought these Crocs because I have other colours which I love, but these black ones appear to be of inferior quality.  The plastic is a lot harder and ungiving and therefore not nearly as comfortable.  Maybe they will soften in time, but I see no reason why a different colour should be any different in quality, especially as the price remains the same and I suspect these are manufactured by a different company, using cheaper materials.

They are very lightweight and very good to wear - not a fashion statement, I have resisted joining the croc brigade but I have been won over by the men in my life wearing crocs and me 'sneakily' slipping theirs on to go out in the garden.

  I have been a fan of crocs for years but had let my collection run down as they gradually wore out. However, I saw these at a good price so bought them...then after about two-weeks foot-enjoyment bought another identical pair.I have never found a pair of shoes that are instantly so comfortable. I have a wide foot and they are perfect for me. These, I am pleased to say, are made in Italy rather than China, so seem to be evidence of a return of manufacturing to the EU. As a Brit I would like to see them made in the UK, of course!Downside to the shoes? The holes in the front let in small stones on the beach, and when the soles wear they become very slippery. Best to use them as slippers at that stage...

  I read all the reviews befor buying these, my first pair of crocs, and took the advise to buy a size larger as these were made in China and were a bit on the small side.  However when they arrived they were made in Italy!  Not sure if a size smaller would have been too small though. There's plently of room, and they fit better with the strap around the heel. Wore them this morning with thin socks and they were fairly snug.  I bought these crocs because I've had a pair of bargain ""Fitflops"" sandals from a charity shop the past year, which are very comfortable, but wanted something for the cooler days that I could wear with or without socks and couldn't afford the fitflop clogs.Overall these crocs fit the bill - well priced - comfortable - love the colour!

  Brilliant Crocs, the fit is perfect I've only ever bought cheaper ones before but thought I'd try the real ones this time, I mainly use these for slippers and in the garden, my old pairs I wash in the washing machine on a short cool wash and they always come out as new, they arrived so promptly after ordering that I was surprised it was so quick, would order from this company again.

Crocs
",David Satchell,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Well made, used as slippers, keep feet cool, comfy, can wear out!  None slip, second pair, first make we're holy sole or something like that and lasted over ten years, I wore everyday and on holidays and in sea. Crocs are better quality and for £17 can't go wrong, been looking to replace my old ones for years and  £30 plus every where glad I waited for price drop to more than half, well looks like crocs aren't getting another sale from me for another 10 years hopefully.

a great multi use shoe
",Barbo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are comfortable versatile shoes which you can wear on the beach or around the house or doing a spot of gardening in, they can be washed under the tap so it doesn`t matter how dirty you get them. the shoe is quite a soft rubber/plastic material so it absorbs shock so your feet are less likely to ache with fatigue, one thing to note the sizes are a little bigger than normal, i bought these for my girlfriend who normally takes a size 6 but she has a size 5 in crocs which fit her perfectly.

My crocs arrived today, I only planned to wear them to the bin or the corner shop (convenient slip on shoes)…I have not removed them from my feet since I put them on!!

Incorrect sizing
",Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I read various reviews about crocs before ordering, and gathered from most that the sizings can be hit or miss. I therefore ordered two different styles and two different sizes.Jolly glad that i did. My normal size is a 6, but the size 6 that i ordered looked more like a childs shoe. There was no way my feet were going to fit into those. The pair i ordered in a different size and style fitted perfectly. My advice for this product would be to either order two pairs in different sizes or go for 2 sizes bigger than you would normally wear.

Otherwise they are the most comfortable summer shoes I've ever bought
",Hamish MacBeth,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are my fifth pair of Crocs - and exactly as I expected. Having heard some adverse comments about Crocs, It is very important  to discard them when the soles wear flat as they can become dangerous in wet conditions. Otherwise they are the most comfortable summer shoes I've ever bought. The fit is important as they should always be a bit big - as advised in the original Crocs fitting guide.JUDITH MACBETH

",PLT,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Crocs may be ugly, but they are enormously comfortable and practical. Crocs are my preferred every day footwear. This is the 6th pair of Crocs that I've bought in the last 6 years. The soles do wear smooth eventually and become dangerously slippery on wet surfaces, so worn out Crocs must be binned and replaced. Crocs are great for the beach, sailing, camping, gardening and anywhere where your feet might get wet. Many naturists wear them on the beach or at their club sites. I love my new summery fuchsia Crocs!

However also warm, when it goes chilly.  The bump pattern, on the internal sole, provides a lovely sensation. No sign of wear and tear yet, but I cannot say how these will last.So far I am a very happy purchaser.

Extremely comfortable crocs
",Britt Jones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I bought these for my job, as my colleague was wearing them and said how cofortable they are. I work long shifts in care, they were ideal for giving showers ( as I was always ruining my usual shoes for this) and they were extremely comfortable, being on my feet all day this is crucial for me. The look is what it is, but for working purposes or beach etc can highly recommend. I loved the chocoltae colour too, but thats preference more than anything

Not all crocks are equal!
",BobD,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Like other reviewers have said, it would appear not all crocks are the same. These are slightly smaller than my last pair. Not too small but smaller. The heal band on my other pairs of crocks can be folded forwards and fits over the top of the main body of the crock but on this pair it is too short. A bit weird! These are made in Italy and my last ones were made in China if that is the reason.

Crocodile Shoes
",Dave,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Always wondered what the real thing would like, so when these came up on sale I grabbed a pair in black. The sizing is quite generous on these so don't be tempted to go to a bigger size. I have worn these with socks on, but the real benefit is wearing them with barefoot and feel the small pimples on the sole massaging your feet. They don't look the prettiest but they are nice and comfortable. 10/10 for me.

  They sent me 'roomy' fit last time so I returned them. They were the right size but I have normal, standard feet.

The length is a comfortable fit without the heel strap
",Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Exactly what you would expect. I am a UK size 5.5 on the most part so I went on sizing chart recommendations and got size M6 W8. I have narrow feet so the roomy design in width feels excessive but I accept this is the only option. The length is a comfortable fit without the heel strap; and a very snug fit with the heel strap. Overall very happy with the product and delivery service was very quick and reliable as you would expect. I also bought my husband a pair (different colour) and he is equally pleased.

Garden shoe.
",Re Church,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I wanted some comfortable slip on footware to wear around the garden and for short walks where I live.I always thought Crocs a bit naff as well as being expensive and not suitable footware for a 68 year old male! After looking around and buying a pair of similar Clarks leather slip on shoes for a holiday, I thought that Crocs might after all be ok.I need not have worried,after reading the reviews I bought a pair and they are brilliant, very light, easy to clean and comfortable. They have a strap that can fit over the back of the heel for greater security, but I have not used it so far. I dont know if I would drive in them as they are quite wide but that's just me.

Gorgeous colour, bit short.
",Fiona McBride,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I love the colour of these,  (viola) butter fit is a little short, more like 4&1/2 than size 5.  They are just a little too short to be comfortable for much walking about, (especially if using back strap which is too far down)  which is a shame.  This is the first pair of actual 'Crocs' brand I have bought, and I think I will stick with cheaper imitations, which actually fit better. I am a small 5 anyway, so these would be WAY too small for someone with broader feet.  Nice colour, shame about the sizing. Cost doesn't always equal comfort! :-/

Useful for going through Customs
",persephone,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Ideal for padding around in and very easy to slip off when going through customs - I have spinal stenosis so bending can be difficult at times.  Wish I had bought a size smaller and perhaps the seller could indicate M(en) and W(omen) because it would not then be necessary to take pot-luck although this does happen when buying on-line.  However, that being said, as I am travelling during the winter months, thick socks will solve that problem.  And of course they are washable.

Great Crocs at a great price
","Jane, Bristol",4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Ordered Crocs from Amazon as I know from experience they will arrive promptly, and they are competitively priced.  I used the Amazon locker collection facility which is great for deliveries.  As yet, I have been unable to return the Crocs using the locker facility (they are a size too big) as there is never a free locker for returns.  I have already ordered and received a size smaller as I needed them quickly, it's looking like I'll be keeping the size 9 crocs and hope they fit my son next year.

",Sramana,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Comfortable and surprisingly cool - not sticky plastic as one would imagine. Can be slippery on wet surfaces. Make sure you get the right size, the label is at least one size bigger than the average for the same label in UK. If you wear women size 5 shoes, order size 4, which may also feel a bit on the large side.

  Getting the right size pair of Crocs is always a challenge and feels like pot luck.This time I was unlucky.Most reviews say they come in small and you should buy the bigger size.I am a size 5 - 5.5 so I followed the advice and bought size 6.They were enormous - felt like a size 7So I sent them backWaiting for size 5 to arrive.Lovely colour though

So much better than the cheap version I've been slopping about in for years!
",Grandma,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Having worn a pair from a well known country store for a long time, I'm so glad I tried the real thing, especially as they were about the same price. They fit perfectly, however I'm actually a size 6.5 and bought a 7 as there were no half sizes. It may be necessary to buy a pair a little on the large size? Looking forward to spending the next 5 years in these - festivals and camping here we come ;-)

  I wanted a pair of clogs for just slipping on and off around the house.  Though friends have told me before how comfortable Crocs are I've resisted buying them before as not sure about the patterned insole and width (I have narrow feet).  All my doubts have proved wrong - they are really comfortable.  I've been wearing them all the time at home and will certainly pack them for my next beach holiday.  They were also an excellent price (I've seen them for a lot more on the high street)

",Denis P.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I shall have to return them. Too loose/sloppy fit despite the correct shoe size chosen. Turns out they are classed as ""roomy fit"". This is a vague term. When I compared them to my old pair, the difference is in the extent of the scallop cut-out area on top of my foot. Thus it's more difficult to keep the croc on. It's a pity the advertisements do not make these subtle differences clear. I should have chosen a ""baha"" style fit apparently.

  Was given a new pair for christmas, same as before which had fitted fine, size 6/8.  New pair far too tight and when checked against old pair, was definitely smaller.  Cheated by going to a local supplier and found I needed a size 7/9, which I got from Amazon, and which fit ok. My feet have'nt got larger but it seems Crocs sizes have got smaller over the past few years. Otherwise as comfortable as ever!

  These crocs would be very comfortable but unfortunately not for me. I have RA and my toes bones are raised and they catch on the shoe. I am so dissapointed. I would have returned them but it would cost too much with Amazon and also you have to print a return lable and I only have a netbook so can't print from it. Don't get me wrong they will be perfect for normal feet.

  Essential home wear - comfy, light, washable and actually quite warm in winter provided you have socks on.

  I knew sizing might be a problem from other reviews, but I thought it had now been overcome, so that UK size 9 meant just that. I was wrong. UK size 9 is much smaller than Croc 'UK size 9'.

There's no substitute for trying something on BEFORE buying it.

His 5th pair now and these were bright, genuine and cheap.With regards to the sizing, Crocs are designed to be bigger than your other shoes - they should not be snug at all and as they are designed for water use and sailing. Your bare foot gets traction on the Croslite material and so they do not slip.

I thought they'd make my feet sweat (not pleasant for anyone!) but not at all - fine with or without socks, which makes them all year round casual footwear.  A great improvement on slippers!  My wife got hers the same time as I did - she doesn't wonder around the site as much as me and hers are good for another year or so at least.  Better still, this supplier managed to sell these for less than the originals - can't be bad.

Love Crocs
",peewit,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I bought these for my brother who was having trouble tying shoe laces due to a back problem - he found these great as he can just shove his feet in them and go - no need for socks even - and comfortable too. I've been wearing Crocs for years - now he's converted too!

Crocs

  A present for my wife.  The colour is wow!  As usual real crocs are well worth having.  They are comfortable and look good.  You cannot have too many crocs because their soles do wear smooth eventually and they become slippery.  So to get crocs at a good price is well worth it.

  Length wise these were as expected.  However I had ordered these crocs which were described as ""roomy"" on the label because I recently had a foot operation and was advised by my consultant that crocs would allow for the foot to swell (depthwise).  What I find is that there is no leeway at all depthwise although I have almost an inch spare at the front should I need it!

  I never thought I would get on with crocs, but these shoes or whatever you call them are great.  Comfortable from the first time I put them on - no chaffing, blisters etc despite walking for several hours one day around a hot dusty hilly town in the Canaries.  At the price I paid they are a steal.

",Dawn J Gordon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  i started wearing Crocs about 8 years ago and I love them.  I have plantar faciitis which means the arch of my foot needs support - Crocs are fantastic.  I have pink ones (I put in my own fleecy liner so they are great as slippers), I have winter 'Polar' ones, brilliant for a nip around the block with the dog in snow/ice - lovely proper fleece insole.  All year round I wear the classic Black.  Love 'em (and always try to buy them out-of-season when they are cheaper on Amazon).

comfort rich crocs

  I hardly wear anything else but crocs. They prevent my feet from aching , (and from smelling) The knobbly bits inside take a little getting used too, but it is worth it for the overall wonderful comfort. I would recommend them to anyone who needs to be on their feet a lot, and for anyone paddling or playing on the beach.The only down side is that they attract dust, and you need to be careful in wet conditions when the grip has worn down

I was looking forward to getting my new crocs! Delivery reasonibly quick. I'll go back and order M5/W6 UK now and hope for the best!

Light and practical
",Nicola Brisley,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These were the first pair of crocs I had bought and have found that they are great for speedy exits to the beach etc. Nice and light so didn't add to our measly on-flight weight allowance and great for paddling in stony rivers and for the beach. However, I still don't get why they are so expensive.  After all, they are just a bit of moulded plastic.  I would probably go for imitation crocs on another occasion.

Also if you order a particular size you don't expect to receive a different one. Size 6 would have been fine.

  Having had these crocs since last Summer, I was surprised to find that had literally shrunk in size - they went from a UK5 to a very small UK4 and no longer fit me.  They had been exposed to the sun at times, but it was very strange to find they had gone so small. It is too late to return them so a waste of money.

comfiest shoe there is
",Nicky,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Crocs are a brilliant invention, the main thing for me is that they are incredibly comfortable, don't knock them till you try them. I used to think they were ugly, but once I put them on and walked about in them I didn't care that they weren't the most stylish footwear in the world! They also aid circulation to the feet, are fungus resistant, shock absorbing, supportive, stable and breathable. Give them a try!

Crocs
",Anon,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  They do the job but half sizes would be welcomed.  I also don't like the rough inner sole.  I assume that it is meant to massage the feet and keep on the Croc, but it's a bit uncomfortable. I just wear them in the house when I wash the floor, so I'm happy enough.

",Miss V J Hayton,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I just love my Crocs, my last pair lasted a number of years before the soles wore down and these are a replacement.  Main advantages over other clogs, are their weight (or lack of it) and the fact that you can clip them on and off easily whether camping, gardening or just coming in from wet/snowy weather.  I would not be without a pair.

As good as anyone says about them, no-one is exaggerating!
",Ch'akori,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I saw someone wearing a pair of Crocs Cayman, and liked the look - they recommended them, and although I had to keep trying to get a big enough size, I am a size 5 but had to go to 7 to get the width for me, I was thrilled.  The huge size does NOT look odd at all, and I have kept on getting more of the Cayman and the Baya - nice thing about Baya Watermelon, is that is has a metallic-like sheen - just a small comment!! I now have got 8 pairs, various colours from sensible to crazy, to indulge myself indoors!!  They do not slide off - I wear as clogs, strap over top, as I am unable to bend down to put on shies.  I do not have to worry about them slipping off, and they really are non-marking.  I find that they do not show scuffs as mushc as one person said, and I got some ""Crocs Butter"" anyhow, to wipe them if they get really scuffed or damaged.  They are fine in winter and summer, I have worn jeans socks inside them, but that was a bit o.t.t. and did stretch the pair after a while, but not enough to bother about.  Fine supermarket cotton socks are perfect if you need a bit of warmth or to hide unsightly ankles, like me. The only problem I have is one that demonstrates how GOOD they are: I have a bit of a job to ""kick them off"" at the door!  This shows how well they grip your feet, without you realising it.  They crease when kneeling or crouching, but the crease fades if left for a couple of days, unlike with leather shoes.  The best buy I have made in all my long life of shoes (having real problem feet - they are shaped like a duck!) No wonder our hospital staff wear them - on hard floors they are a cushion, on carpet they are like a soft mattress!  Amazon - I ought to have said to start with - delivery long before expected, absolutely NO problems with returning or queries, the best service I have received ever, and I do mean that.

don't know what I'd do without them.....
",IOK,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I remember the first pair of Caymans I bought; I stood in the shop, looking down at my Croc-clad feet and I said to the shop owner ""God they're ugly..."". He didn't take offence because after all he didn't design them but he did cautiously say ""well they are very popular"".Right ok then, because I needed something to wear around the house and there was no way I was ever going to allow anyone other than my husband and children to see me wearing them anyway.I'm on my second pair now, because after about 2 years of intense use the soles were worn smooth. I wear them all the time, indoors and out, school runs, beach, pool, supermarket. As anyone who owns a pair will know they are just sooooooo comfortable! The clunky look has grown on me and it's a bit of a cult thing isn't it? Besides, beauty's only skin deep and if you like your feet you'll give them Crocs, style be damned.The only thing I will say, in the hope that the Croc people might read this, is that I would love a selection of different designs colour-wise i.e. marbled or tie dye, in the adult sizes.

",Peter Vince,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Great purchase. Had a bursa on my achilles tendon making any shoes impossible to wear. Have worn these every day this summer they are so comfortable. Many thanks to Amazon for dealing so fast and efficiently with the pathetic Royal Mail next day by 1pm delivery service. I waited until midday and then saw on the Royal Mail tracking site that they had already been delivered and if I didn't have them they must be at a neighbour's house! Tried the obvious neighbours, no, so we went out and came back to find.............a sorry you were not in card! Phoned up and complained and they arranged for a next working day delivery before 1pm. Didn't arrive again and the web site said they had been delivered at 7.31 am!! And this time nobody was answering the phones because of industrial action. Told Amazon the next day and they sent me a new pair, no quibbles, which arrived the next morning. Thanks Amazon. I have emailed and written complaints to the Royal Mail and have received...........no reply.

Crocs Cayman clog
",Amazon Customer,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I ordered these shoes for my partner, a size 40, but when they arrived we found them too large.  I'd also ordered a pair of Crocs Mammoth Clogs, which fitted snugly.  It is strange that two pairs of the same make of shoe should vary in sizing, but we noticed that they are made in different countries, which may have something to do with it.  Rather annoying!

Fit as Expected After Research of the Brand
",Butterflies&Bakedgoods,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  When I first tried these shoes on I thought that they were too large. I'm a female who takes a UK 6.5 so I ordered the size 6men's/7female's. This size has actually turned out to be the correct size after having researched the way this particular model of these shoes should fit - I looked on the Crocs website (see pictures).  I would recommend that if you are unsure of what size to buy that you buy two pairs - after all one can always go back. These shoes are very roomy...and are supposed to be that way. They have space at the back, front and round the sides. They feel loose at first but after an hour or two of wearing them at home they were fine and even began to conform to the shape of my feet.  if you prefer a more regular fit I suggest getting a smaller size than usual.  Overall I am happy with purchase and would recommend Crocs to anyone.  They are lightweight and suportive.

  This is the fifth pair of Cayman Crocs I now own and I love them and so does my 4 yr old daughter.  They are so comfortable and easy to slip on and off, lovely on your feet. I also ordered a pair for my 14 yr old son who claimed he hated Crocs until he 'borrowed' mine to pop into the garden recently.  He now loves them too.  As my husband felt left out he too has invested in a pair. He wasn't sure at first but likes them now too!!!

BLISS
",Gillie,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I've lived with chronic back pain for over 30 years and finding comfortable summer footwear has always been a problem. I've tried lots of different summer shoes and sandals, including Scholl, but none that were comfortable enough to wear all day.Friends who wear Crocs have said they'd be the only shoes they'd wear if they could but I didn't think they'd be any good for me, they look so uncomfortable. But this year I decided to try them, after all I had nothing to lose I could always return them. I chose the Classic Clog because this was the style I'd seen friends wearing.Well, I have to say I was stunned when I put them on, it was like magic, I've never had slippers feel this good to wear. One reviewer said she forgot she'd got them on and nearly went to bed with them on. I thought this was probably an exaggeration but I owe her an apology because you really do forget you've got them on and I nearly did the same.I wear them nearly all the time now, the only time I don't wear them is when it's raining or very cold.At last I have a pair of shoes that allow my feet to 'breathe' on hot days and that don't increase my pain when I wear them all day, aaahh BLISS.

  Crocs are my favourite shoes i have been buying them for years, we hada nice little Croc shop in Meadowhall that i used all the time until it closed recently :(So i decided to order a pair of Crocs from Amazon they arrived quickly but when i tried them on felt a little tight even though i had ordered the size i have worn comfortably for years, i decided to keep the as i thought that they must give as my other pairs have always been so comfy from the start, anyway they are still tight and feel a size smaller than the ones i nomally wear even though it says there the same size so i have returned to wearing my old pair as these just dont feel right :(

  Size 10 Crocs review.I bought these as the I lost the ones I got from Primark, which were much cheaper, I tried to buy some more there but they did not have any.These are a touch pricey, I was thinking of returning them as they did initially feel a bit small, but I kept them and glad I did.  They are not as light as those from Primark. But not a major problem.They are very comfortable, go on buy them, only real downside is the price.

Converted to Crocs !!!!!!!!
",kazzyb37,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Well, where to start , hmmm......  Well, I was amazed how quickly they were delivered, many thanks !I have only recently discovered Crocs,  and I can honestly say that they are the BEST things I have ever worn on my feet !  I suffer with plantar spur tendonitis ( whatever it's called.. or policeman's heel ),  and these Crocs are the only footwear which relieves my pain and discomfort.  They even help my knees too,  because I can walk properly in Crocs.  I splashed out and bought a pair of work Crocs too, and I can now get through my 12 hour shifts in the care sector without being on  my hands and knees , nor hobbling like I'm crippled !!  With my work Crocs, because they're not vented and I have been blessed with the world's most sweaty feet, I do have to wear a little pair of trainer socks so my feet don't slip about in them.I was concerned about some previous reviews saying that the Crocs seems to be smaller sized ,  but my size 5's are perfect !!I wear Crocs all the time , round the house, walking the dog- even in muddy fields, it feels so funny to have the mud squelching round your feet and toes, then just swill your feet in the nearest puddle or stream !! lol !!  Perfect on rough terrain too.Bung them in the washer if they get smelly or dirty... and just shove them straight back on your feet, no need to wait for them to dry !  Irritating stones in shoes just find their way out again.I am totally converted to Crocs, for the comfort and practical reasons.  The first time I wore them, I was concerned that the nubs would make my feet sore, but nope, they don't.  A little piece of heaven for my feet.  !!!!!!

My new purple crocs
",Elizabeth Ahir,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I am a size 6.5 and have bought Crocs before and bought W6/M8. However, the Crocs I have purchased in the past were made in China but as they are on the large size but fitted me. So I ordered a pair of size 6,only to find that they were too small! This is because they were made in Mexico and are the correct sizing. So if you're a size 6.5 be sure to order size 7!

Hmmm!
",Sue.C,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I've always fancied a pair of crocs so decided to go for them as they seemed such a reasonable price. The colour was fab but these were enormous. I'm a size 7-8 depending on who's footwear it is, I would actually recommend going down a size. I have sent them back and asked for a refund, seller very helpfully and very quick in refunding payment. I would actually deal with them again.

  just received my crocs today,and to say that i'm pleased with them would be an understatement,this is my first pair of crocs so i wasn't sure what to expect having previously put off buying them due to the way they look,but they are so light and comfortable that i havent taken mine off since i received them first thing this morning and i can honestly say that i recomend them 100%,so if the look of these is putting you off i recomend that you go ahead and buy them anyway,i prommise you wont be disappointed,i like these so much in fact that i'm about to buy another pair for my friends birthday,a truly first class product with a first class service to boot.

  These crocs are of the usual good quality, but I found them to be a little on the small side.

Are these genuine Crocs?
",RJL,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have owned 3 pairs of Crocs over the years. I purchased these and they felt they were made of inferior material to my previous pairs. I returned them to Amazon and the replacement Crocs were just the same. The rubber is harder and jars the feet when walking in them, so I have to question if these are genuine Crocs?

Size warning
",DLB,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Ordered UK size 6 and received ones with a label saying 5.5. Amazon were quick to replace the item and the next pair had a label saying size 6. However, the sizing on the bottom of the Crocs was identicle to the original pair sent so they were no different to the pair I returned. I would strongly recommend future customers to purchase a half size bigger than required if u always buy the same size shoe i.e. I always take a 6 so I need  a 6.5 in these for them to be comfortable. I have obviously kept the item as it has been delivered as ordered but I don't think they'll get much wear! It would be good if the company made people aware of the possible sizing issues.

First Crocs - very comfortable
",Blue,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are my first Crocs. I wanted shoes for wearing around the house during the better weather - comfortable but easy to slip on and off. These Crocs definitely fit those requirements. Straight away I could feel the solid support in the soles. I wear them without the support strap in place at the back.Size wise I normally take a UK 11. I found it a bit confusing when choosing a size. At the time Amazon automatically suggested the Crocs unisex size M10/W11 as they know I normally wear UK 11. Confusingly in the drop down menu there was an option for UK 11 aswell. I had to compare the different sizes on Amazon, Crocs UK and Crocs Europe. I ended up going with UK 11 as it corresponded to the European size 46 which I get in Ecco shoes.Also note on the Crocs website they have different fittings. The ones I received were a 'roomy fit'.This is the data with my shoes - Amazon were the direct seller:Size: unisexUS: m12Euro: 46-47UK: m11/m12Roomy fitMade in Italy

  After having read several reviews from people who had had crocs, I ordered my first ever pair, when they arrived I noted the country of origin (as had been mentioned in a few of customers reviews) and mine were made in Italy, the fit is perfect and extremely comfortable. I have a broad foot with a high instep and an arthritic joint at the base of one big toe, but these crocs are a really comfortable wear. I cannot recommend them highly enough. Brilliant!

Keep trying to find the right fit
",Frances,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have tried a few different styles of clogs but returned to the classic to get the right length and width. In a shoe I take a UK size 7, but the recommended M6/W7 was too small so I picked the M7/W8 and they feel just like my original clogs slightly wider and longer that I would have in a shoe but great in a clog. These clogs are made in Italy and have 8 and 10 on the sole which I assume means M8 /W10 but it is very difficult to understand the sizing of crocs as they are made in several different countries which all have different sizes to the UK shoes. Trying them seems to be the only way of getting the right fit.

Not Happy
",Margaret O'Connor,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I suffer from plantar fasciatis in both heels and was recommended these crocs by a friend who had suffered from the same ailment and got great relief from this type of shoe.  Within half an hour of putting them on I was in complete agony and spent several hours afterwards off my feet as I was unable to even hobble, never mind walk.  Needless to say I was very disappointed as I expected to be able to walk easier and relatively pain free once I wore them.  However, they did arrive in excellent time and were comfortable once I put them on, shoe size, width etc. was spot on.  My problems only began once I actually started to walk in them.  Perhaps this type of shoe helps mild plantar fascitis but it is definitely not good for the more debilitating type.  I would recommend these shoes only for people who do not suffer from pain in their feet.

Here is some size guidance for buyers based on my experience!
",Ellie B,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I did select the size I wanted luckily, but I found the way the sizes are written in the option list potentially confusing and I would think other potential buyers might find the same! So, to help future buyers, you may find it useful to know that I am a ladies 6.5UK size and I selected ""6 UK (M)/ 7 UK (W)"" from the size options listed, which was just right. So ladies who are only just a size 6 might find the size ""5UK(M)/ 6UK (W)"" a better fit. For those of you who have bought Crocs previously, and know what Crocs size fits you as labelled on the sole, you might also find it helpful to know that the sole of the ""6 UK (M)/ 7 UK (W)"" Crocs I bought actually says ""7M  9W"". I therefore presume that the size listed as 5 UK (M)/ 6 UK (W) says ""6M  8W"" on the sole, and so on. The Crocs I received are made in Italy.

New Crocs to replace my old ones
",Ruth,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Ordered these in the size i had had before and made sure that they came from Italy but when the size 4 came were much too small. Returned for a size 5 exchange was very easy and replacement ones came quickly, but i HATE them. I measured them against my old ones which now have hardly any tread on them as i have worn them to death and they seemed the same size however wore them for a week on holiday as felt fine for a couple of days but then they rubbed and i have HUGE blisters on the sides of my heel and little toe. The next size up would be much too big and i never had this problem with my old ones, so as i have worn them for a week will try them again when my feet have healed up and if they are still as uncomfy will bin them. Very disappointed as i loved my old crocs and expected these to be as comfy so dont know what the problem is.

UK Sizing Incorrect
",Windydotcom,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These genuine Crocs were not a UK size 12 as advertised and as per the Crocs label.  I have been buying my Dad size 12 Crocs for years without any problem with the sizing.  His Crocs that fit have the number 12 on the sole.  These had a number 13 on the sole but the label clearly stated ""UK 12"".  They were too big.  My Dad has mobility issues and having shoes that fit is imperative to his being able to walk safely and confidently.  Unfortunately I could not return as I trusted the label which I had removed and had written my Dad's name on (he lives in a care-home).  This has put me off buying genuine Crocs on-line.

Shrunk
",Lynn,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  My husband previously bought a pair of crocs and we left them by the garden gate to use in the garden. Unfortunately, they shrunk! Size 8 became size 6 (mine are size 5, they are slightly bigger than mine) so there is no way that my husband’s feet can be fitted in. But they were comfortable, so I decided to buy him a new pair, bigger than his normal size! However, when he had a try, they were just about the right size for my husband’s feet! I didn’t want to have a pair of size 7 in 1-2 years of light use, so I had to return them and buy an even bigger pair! So complicated! Not very happy.

They were very comfortable for him and he had quite a few colour choices too. He even wore them back in the UK on hot days! People say they aren't fashionable, but my goodness they are so comfy.

Great quality, comfort & durability
",Family McCarthys,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Loved these from the moment I bought them. They have very good support and are quite hard wearing. I mostly wear them as slippers, with a few trips outdoors and they are still going strong.Pattern on the sole has worn, but there is still plenty of padding between me and the floor. I also find them quite warm. They are better than other slippers I have used in that they have air holes, so my feet don't get overly hot in the house. Very comfortable and long lasting.

Inconsistent sizes - buy in a real shop
",Alejo,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  This is the 3rd pair of Crocs I have bought online. Always same size, for my father and myself. However, this time, although the specs are exactly the same (as shown on the soles) the crocs are 2 cm shorter than previous pairs. We only noticed this fault when I gave the crocs as a gift to my dad, who lives overseas. It is frustrating and embarrassing. Also, it is very inconvenient to bring the crocs back to the UK, ship them back, etc. Very poor experience due to these nonsensical, inconsistent sizes. My advice: buy your Crocs in a normal retail store, as Amazon has proved unreliable in relation to sizes.

Suddenly I see what the fuss is all about
",tiggrie AKA Sarah,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Previously I've been left nonplussed by the appeal of Crocs. I have long, narrow feet, with high arches, and every pair I ever tried on were just plain old uncomfortable. I'd long since given up hope of finding a pair that were comfortable enough for me to wear for more than three minutes. They always felt too tight or like they were about to fall off or too short or...Then I tried on a pair of these, and was surprised and impressed by how comfortable they were. I have to have the strap round the back of my foot, but when I do, they're very comfy, and feel very firmly on my feet without being too tight.I love the nubbed soles, they are just textured enough to give your feet a gentle massage without being distracting or annoying.In use, they're incredibly light and comfortable. My preference is for shoes you can forget you're wearing, and these definitely fit that description to a tee. I usually walk round the house barefoot for preference, but these I will keep on and forget I'm wearing even in doors. At the same time, I can happily walk round in them for several hours without any bad results.I wasn't convinced how comfortable they'd be, since they're basically kind of plastic. I remember loathing jelly shoes and similar. However, the material has not got sweaty or unpleasant to wear even on the hottest days I've worn them, and they're so well ventilated that my feet feel fresh all the time. The light foam material is surprisingly soft and forgiving to touch, even though the shoe as a whole feels fairly sturdy. Granted, I've only had them a few months, but they don't feel like they're about to fall apart on me or anywhere close.Last but not least: the colour. I confess, I bought the candy pink purely because they were the cheapest option in my size. They looked inoffensive in the picture, and I'm partial to a bit of pink, so I figured they'd be OK. Actually, they're really pretty and feminine - I was impressed. The colour is a very delicate, pretty pink, and has a decidedly pearly look about it. Obviously these aren't smart, formal shoes, but for crocs they're surprisingly attractive. Instead of being relegated to home and garden, I've worn them out and about to people's houses and to the shops without feeling like I was being a total scruffbag!In short: I'm a convert. Clearly, with crocs, one needs to experiment to find the ones that suit, but once you do... These babies will be used till they fall apart!

A point to remember...
",EnglishMiss,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I bought my Crocs years ago - when they were made in Italy.Nowadays, they all seem to be made in - yes you've guessed it - China.It's not an improvement in my opinion, as the rubber seems less flexible and the sizing is definitely iffy.I got my last pair - Crocs Relief, made in China ! - through Crocs and despite some reviews saying they came up "" larger than size "", I chose a half size larger than usual and they were still a snug fit.THIS pair fits me perfectly, BUT I bought ONE WHOLE SIZE LARGER than my usual size 5, and when compared to my "" old "" Italian made, size 5s - they are SMALLER THAN THEM !!!So buyers,be aware of the sizing element.This pair was well priced though, and I DO recommend Crocs - they are really not that nice looking, but if you have foot problems ( I have Plantar Fasciitis ) or just wide feet, they are great !.

  I nearly purchased some Cocs about five years a go, but ultimately chose not to because I thought they looked ridiculous, regardless of how comfortable they supposedly were!I have finally given in and bought a pair, perhaps it's the fact I'm five years older and nearing forty?!I have to say they are amazing; they are so comfortable and a joy to wear. They feel great on the sole of your foot, and the level of comfort and support when walking is first class.Yes they do look a little silly perhaps, and I have promised my fiancee I won't be wearing them out of the house, they have been specifically purchased for use in the back garden; but then again promises are there to be broken!I'm very happy with this purchase, and yes, I'm a Croc convert!

Too small, despite ordering the correct UK size
",Tim,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Too small, despite ordering the correct UK size.  I always fit into UK size ten and half or size 11 shoes.Despite the fact that Amazon converts Crocs's american sizes to UK sizes in the ordering page, these crocs shoes were still too small.  When wearing them without the strap at the back lowered, they were OK.  But when wearing them with the strap lowered my toes nails scraped the the end of the shoe and it made the fit uncomfortable.I recommend you use Amazon's excellent ""wardrobe"" service where you can order many items of clothing in different sizes and then return the unwanted items without paying for them. The return process is easy, just rebag the items in the resealable bag , stick the return label on it and take it to a Royal Mail location.

Made in Italy
",MKH,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Looking at other reviews, I was a little concerned that I might get Crocs made in China. However, I can confirm that the navy Crocs I bought direcly from Amazon UK in August 2013 were made in Italy, both sizes 4 and 5. I first bought UK size 4, as this is my normal size, but they were small in length. I exchanged them to UK size 5, which are better in length. They are very wide, though; but this is the nature of Crocs, I suppose. I am happy with them as I wear them only by the pool or beach and not in the street.Buying shoes online and getting the sizing right is quite tricky. If it helps anyone, after some years of experience, I now decided that for women's UK size 4, I should sometimes be ready to get size 3 if the shoes are from Europe (e.g. Fly London) or size 5 if the shoes are from North America (e.g. Crocs; they are originally from Canada even if made in other countries these days). But I would always try size 4 first, naturally.

  I needed to replace my fake crocs from last summer but the cheap ones this summer didn't seem to fit properly.  I wear them all the time. They have gradually replaced my slippers during the day - great when you realise you have popped outside to put the washing out and it was wet and muddy - you just pop them under the tap - not so easy with fluffy slippers!  So when I found these at sale price I was over-the-moon.  I am a 6.5 and I bought size 7. They are comfy and versatile and they were also the only shoes I could squeeze on with swollen ankles for the last three weeks of my pregnancy. They are easy to put on when you just need to pop out to the car etc.  How did I ever manage without a pair.

  Having read all the other reviews about being careful when choosing the right size, I made sure to really note the size and gender when selecting a suitable pair of CROCS......BUT if it is unisex, as this is, then there is no option of male or female and by selecting 8 it means men's 8, and women's 10.  Why can't this be made clearer?  I will have to exchange them now.  What a shame.

  My husband had an ankle replacement which was very successful but shoes became a major problem due to the enlarged joint and swelling when wearing normal shoes.  We bought some Crocs 3 years ago recommended by a friend to use on the beaches in Malta to prevent being stung by jelly fish.  We didn't see any jelly fish but he never looked back after that.  The Crocs have been in continuous use ever since, both with casual and smart gear and he is now on his 3rd pair.  The ankle doesn't swell even after a whole day's wear and he's prepared to put up with the jokes when he forgets to change shoes for special occasions.

When I put them on for the first time, the soles of my feet did feel a little strange for around ten minutes or so when I was walking.  Once I was used to them, my feet were the most comfortable they had been in years.  I now wear them at every opportunity - this summer, I've had lots of practice at checking out how quickly they dry out after being caught in the rain, too!

  I recently had a problem with one of my feet and had trouble walking. I found that Crocs were the only comfortable shoes I could wear, and have been using them exclusively for months on end. This is a third pair, although the others are still in good condition.Recommended for comfort for just about everything.

",D. J.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These crocs cayman are so comfortable and a must for summer hols. I bought mine for a recent beach holiday and they are terrific on sand... especially when it gets too hot to walk on in bare feet. I wore them throughout the holiday and I'm so glad I bought them. I would say stick to ordering your usual size coz they are roomy. Happy ordering and holidays!

Crocs rule
",Mr. A. Walton,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I bought theses on a recommendation from a friend. I thought they were probably the ugliest shoes I'd ever set my eyes on. Put that to one side because they are the best footwear I've ever bought. They are light and comfortable beyond belief. The strange rubber like material keeps the feet cool and the textured insole keeps the feet alive. I took them on holiday to Cornwall and ended up wearing no other shoes for the entire holiday. They even coped with a long and difficult costal path walk. Cant sing their praises high enough. Need to order another pair because I'm going to wear these out the rate I'm going.

Super great footwear!!
",S. Beardon,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are fantastic shoes for anyone, very comfortable to wear with socks or without. Ideal for summer months keep are kept cool. Soft material means they do not rub feet. Easy to clean and dry quickly. Come in a range of colours so can co-ordinate with outfits. Very reasonable if they are on offer as they last a long time.

  These crocs are much too wide for me- like boats and I also find them too long. I am always a size 7 but these are ridiculously large. It will depend on how much it will cost to return these as to whether I will send them back. If too expensive will give to a friend.

  Very comfortable and light with nice wide fitting. Good for those (like me) with foot problem. I wear them around house instead of slippers. Light spongy material keeps warmth in. Wide fitting enables thick socks to be worn.Not sure how good they would be for use outside.

  Never thought that you would get me walking around in these things. I've had to think again, bought one pair, took them on holiday and wore nothing else. These I just bought are a different colour, just to let people know I have more than one pair of shoes. They are the only shoes I will take on holiday. Go in one pair and pack the others. They are so light too. Just one thing, buy a size larger.

Be careful re sizing!
",JB,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  This item was advertised as size 4 however on arrival they are labelled as 3/4 and so were just totally the wrong size, too small.It think it would have been helpful for a more accurate description and actual sizes to be available as I will not risk another order as the only option available it would seem is now a 5/6 which is likely to be too big so a lost sale.

",C. Meaden,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have bought Crocs before and have always found them to be very comfortable. These are just as good. I live in Spain and find Crocs are one of the best things to wear, particularly at home in the summer, because they are lightweight and are washable. They might not be very elegant or glamorous but that isn't why I bought them.  For me, they are comfy and practical. Perfick!

Good product but too small
",Mr Stephen John Barnett,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Might be worth noting that Crocs are manufactured in several countries.  They all look the same and are of similar quality but the 'moulds' used in each location can differ by anything up to a full shoe size so you can't always rely on them fitting even if you order identical sizes.  I didn't know about this until after I'd ordered them.  However returning these was very easy and I am waiting for a replacement pair - just a bit bigger!

Croc Comfort

  I have a number of different styles of Crocs and would recommend them to everyone who enjoys being comfortable. A great advantage with Crocs is the ability to wash the whole shoe e.g. a muddy forest walk or a sandy beach walk (though not in winter)and it only takes 5 minutes.There are a number of styles available all equally as comfortable, but some more stylish than others. I wouldn't be without them.

  Die Schuhe passen gut und sind bequem. Da ich sie hauptsächlich im Garten und auf der Terrasse benutzt habe, standen sie logischerweise auch mal in der Sonne - mit dem Ergebnis, dass sie nach nur 3-4 Wochen mindestens 3 Größen geschrumpft sind! Im ersten Moment dachte ich, dass ein Kind seine Schuhe aus Versehen bei uns stehen gelassen hat, weil ich mir gar nicht erklären konnte, wieso ich plötzlich nicht mehr in die Schuhe passte!Dabei wirbt der Hersteller mit ""der perfekte Schuh für Strand oder Boot!"" Nur darf die Sonne eben nicht länger scheinen. Amazon hat kulanterweise den Schuh zurückgenommen und den Kaufpreis erstattet, obwohl die Frist zur Rückgabe bereits verstrichen war.Da bereits mehrere Käufer von demselben Phänomen berichten, sollte man den Schuh auf keinen Fall kaufen, wenn man vorhat, ihn auch draußen zu benutzen. Sehr enttäuschend.

  Nach dem meine alten Crocs ca. 5 Jahre auf dem Buckel hatten mussten neue her.Sie hatten bei mir echt viel zu leisten!Gartenarbeit, Renovieren, Sommerurlaube in heißen Regionen(Türkei, Thailand), Segeltörns etc.Sie waren immer und überall dabei.Auf den Fotos mal ein Vergleich.Man sieht auf den Fotos auch, das sie sich im laufe der Zeit etwas verformt haben und sich auch die Farbe etwas verändert hat.Sie haben im letzten Sommer lange in der Sonne auf den heißen Terrassenplatten gelegen.Dadurch sind sie ein bisschen schmaler, aber nicht kürzer geworden.So lange hält sonst kein Schuh bei mir!Die alten Crocs waren ""Made in Italy"" und und neuen jetzt sind es auch.Sie riechen gar nicht! Haben die alten auch nicht.Es scheint an der Farbe zu liegen, wo sie hergestellt werden.Ich kann diese Crocs in dunkelblau auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen

  Finger weg, Schuhe schrumpfen bei Wärme. Verkäufer lehnt Gewährleistung mit folgender Begründung ab:""Wir entschuldigen uns für Ihre schlechten Erfahrungen. Leider ist das Schrumpfen der Crocks jeden Sommer ein häufiges Problem. Wir verstehen Ihre Unzufriedenheit vollkommen und es ist unsere Politik, jeden Kundenanspruch zu untersuchen, aber in diesem Fall können wir nicht viel tun. Die Garantie von Crocs deckt keine physischen Schäden ab, die durch Missbrauch und falsche Handhabung durch den Benutzer verursacht wurden.Einige Fälle, in denen Crocs-Schuhe wahrscheinlich schrumpfen, sind:- wenn in einem heißen Auto gelassen;- wenn in der Spülmaschine gewaschen;- wenn draußen in der Sonne gelassen.Dies ist kein Herstellungsfehler.Im Internet finden Sie verschiedene Tutorials, mit denen Sie Ihre Schuhe reparieren und wieder anziehen können.""Die Schuhe wurden -naturgemäß- draussen gelagert, da sie als Gartenschuhe Verwendung finden sollten. Bei der ersten Hitzeperiode (35 Grad) sind sie geschrumpft und passen -vorher Gr. 46/47- nun noch Gr. 40. Wir haben seit vielen Jahren viele Modelle an Crocs, aber diese ""Qualität"" ist uns neu. Keine Kaufempfehlung!

  Ho comperato l'ennesimo paio di Crocs: queste sono di un bell'arancione ""energetico"". Sono allegre e non fanno l'effetto ciabatta. Per chi dovesse comprare il primo paio: ricordatevi che calzano un po' piccolo: io porto il 36 e compero 36-37 ma le uso come ciabatte e non utilizzo il listello posteriore (lo ruoto davanti); se lo utilizzassi compererei il 37-38. Lo stesso vale per il modello ""imbottito""

  Premetto che è la prima volta che acquisto un paio di crocs... Sono casalinga e sfrutto queste scarpe dalla mattina alla sera: mi sembrava assurdo pagare 30 euro per delle brutte ciabatte in plastica, ma siccome le ho trovate in offerta a 20,99 e avendo anche un po di mal di schiena, ho detto "" le provo, mi faccio il regalo di Natale!"" .Adesso, dopo un mese, il mal di schiena non me lo ricordo neanche più! Inoltre ieri ho lavato le nuove crocs ed, il tempo che stavano asciugando, ho indossato le vecchie ciabatte (una sotto marca tipo le crocs)... La differenza è scioccante: con le originali il piede è più riposato e rilassato, rialzato di circa 1 cm; la camminata è più sicura nella scarpa, non si scivola! Ciliegina sulla torta: sono Made in Italy!Conclusione: le ricomprerei ad occhi chiusi, sempre ed ovviamente se scontate!!!

  Nachdem ich 2 Paar ""Billig-Crocs"" hatte, die sehr schnell kaputt gegangen sind, habe ich mir im Angebotspreis die Original Crocs bestellt. Und ich bin begeistert! Es ist ein riesen großer Unterschied, ob man wirklich nur Billig-Crocs kauft oder die Originalen. Die Original Crocs sind von sehr guter Qualität, es sind sehr stabile ""Plastik-Schuhe"" mit dicker Sohle; sie sind viel stabiler wie diese dünnen ""windigen"" Billig-Crocs.Allerdings muss ich hier eins bemerken: ich habe die hellblauen Crocs gekauft, die sind ""made in Italy"". Es gibt aber andere Farben mit made in China, made in Mexico oder sonstige..... also die Herstellung ist offenbar in unterschiedlichen Ländern. Das sieht man aber bereits deutlich auf den Produktbildern, da hier bei jedem Paar Crocs die Sohle abgebildet ist (auf dem das Herstellerland steht).Meine made-in-italy-Crocs sind hervorragend, kein Chemie-Geruch und auch sonst keinerlei negative Punkte. Wie das bei den anderen Crocs ist, kann ich leider nicht beurteilen.Für meine made-in-italy-Crocs gibt es volle 5 Sterne. Spitzen Qualität zu einem Angebotspreis, was will man da noch sagen! Daumen hoch!

  Ich weiß nicht, warum Crocs es nötig hat, mittlerweile in vielen anderen Ländern wie Vietnam, China undMexico die Schuhe zu produzieren, wahrscheinlich, weil es dort billiger ist. Leider bestätige ich die Rezensionen,die besagen, dass die aus diesen Ländern stammenden Schuhe echt übel chemisch stinken, das habe ich sogarim hiesigen Schuhgeschäft live festgestellt. Ich habe einen Schuh made in Italy gefunden und einen made ich China,der Unterschied war wirklich extrem!Und obwohl auf dem Produktfoto zu sehen war, dass der Schuh in Mexicogefertigt sein soll, erhielt ich gelbe Crocs made in Italy. Sie sind gernauso gut von der Qualität, wie die allerersten,die wir vor langer Zeit gekauft haben. Andere hätte ich auch zurückgeschickt!!Es ist mittlerweile echt schwer, noch welche zu bekommen, die in Italien gefertigt werden. Schade.Wie gesagt, wir hatten Glück...

  Es increíble porque  hace años compré, en un bazar chino, unos de estos por 5 euros y no he vuelto a encontrar otros tan cómodos. Ni siquiera en los propios bazares, donde todos los que encuentro ahora son ""Made in Portugal"".  En cambio, los que tengo, están hechos en China, y son lo más cómodo que han calzado mis pies. Pero claro: están descoloridos del todo, por el sol y el paso del tiempo y dan pena... Y aún así, siguen siendo comodísimos.Compré estos, que valen bastante más, tras leer las reseñas, y esperando que fueran igual o al menos la mitad de cómodos que mis moribundos zuecos chinos. Pues no.  Mientras que los que tengo tienen forma anatómica por dentro, y carecen de ""púas"",  estos son completamente planos, no se adaptan a  forma del pie y las gomitas que sobresalen me resultan muy, muy molestas.Otra cosa: si yo tengo el pie ancho, y estos zuecos se me salen, de lo anchos y holgados que son, no quiero imaginar cómo le deben ir a alguien con pie normal o estrecho.No los devuelvo porque mira...  Pero vaya: desde luego no es la mejor compra que haya hecho en Amazon.

  Acquistate per l'utilizzo in un reparto ospedaliero.Per me, comode alla perfezione per almeno 10h su 12 di guardia .Il fatto che siano un unico pezzo di gomma le rende facilmente lavabili.Considerate che per la stessa ragione non offrono alcun riparo dal freddo.Prima di queste ho provato dei cloni cinesi che dopo 6 ore non sono più comode. IL MATERIALE CROCS FA LA DIFFERENZA!Portando 43 ho comprato un 43 poi cambiato (nel giro di 3 giorni grazie ad amazon!!) con 42-43 e va LEGGERMENTE largo con un calzino di spugna normale.NOTA PERSONALE : Non ho capito molto le taglie ma se a qualcuno può servire dalla punta dell'alluce al tallone il mio piede è 26,5cm e un 42 sarebbe stato perfetto. Ovviamente è solo un'indicazione. Non posso garantire per tutti i piedi!

  Die Crogs wurden schnell geliefert.Eigentlich ist 1 Stern zuwenig, aber ich war so irritiert als sie kamen, das ich erst dachte eine Kopie gekauft zu haben.Die Größe ist nun ganz anders als ""früher""Ich habe derzeit - wie auf dem Bild zu sehen - ganz alte Crogs die mindestens 10 Jahre alt sind. Nun sind sie durchgelaufen, und einer an in der Sohle ein Loch. Deshalb mussten neue her.Ich habe die Größe, die 37/38 angegeben ist gekauft.Sie passen mir wie erwartet. Dennoch wundert es mich, das die alten eine Nummer kleiner waren, aber dennoch größer sind als die neuen.Also kauft jemand dieselbe Größe wie seine alten sind, werden sie viiiiiiiel zu groß sein.Auf meinen alten steht noch ""Made in Italy"" auf den neuen ""Made in Vietnam"". Tja....Außerdem finde ich das die neuen härter sind als die alten. Nicht mehr so flexibel.Fazit:Man kann sie kaufen, zumindest meine Farbe war günstig, aber andere sind teurer, und da würde ich schon nicht mehr empfehlen.Ich bin sehr gespannt wie sie sich in der Sonne verhalten, denn einige schreiben sie würden schrumpfen.Wenn dem so ist, haben sie nicht mal 1 Stern verdient.Meine jetzigen haben in all den Jahren ihre Größe beibehalten.Ich bin gespannt, und sollte dem so sein, das sie sich verändern werde ich leider nie wieder welche kaufen.

  Materiale è leggermente più rigido rispetto ad altre crocs che ho preso in passato, spero siano originali, verificherò se con l’utilizzo sì ammorbidiranno, sono comunque comode ed il colore rispecchia le foto. Bisogna fare peró molta attenzione alle taglie, ho ordinato un 43/44 uomo basandomi su guida taglie, ma sono giustine,  anche se indicato 10 USA equivalgono ad un 42/43 scarso cioè 8/9 USA. Nella foto ho messo di fianco le Crocs nuove e quelle vecchie acquistate da altro fornitore. Come si può notare sono di identica dimensione ma su quelle nuove è indicato 10 USA mentre su quelle vecchie 9.  entrambe penso invece siano  42/43, cioè 8. I produttori cinesi fanno sempre casino sulle taglie, anche se su quelle nuove è indicato made in italy(!?) poi sull’etichetta che sino importare...e su quelle vecchie made in china...che erano sicuramente originali.

Al ser unisex, son más anchos de lo habitual para mujer. A mí me sobra más o menos un dedo de largo y me resultan muy cómodas así. Quizá otra persona las prefiera más ajustadas o si tenéis el pie muy fino puede que os resulte más incómoda.Llevo usándolas un tiempo y estoy contenta con ellas.

  Die Crocs wurden wie angekündigt von Amazon geliefert. Zunächst passte auch alles. Habe absichtlich eine Nummer grösser bestellt. Die Schuhe waren angenehm zu tragen. Nach 5 Wochen und einigen Tagen aufenthalt der Crocs auf der Terasse waren diese um min. 2 Nummern geschrumpft. Zudem hatten sich die Schuhe so in Längsachse verwunden das ein reinschlüpfen kaum möglich ist. Das Tragen ist durch die Verwindung auch sehr unangenhem.Der Kundenservice von Amazon ist wirklich sehr freundlich. Ich bekomme ein neues Paar schuhe kostenlos zugeschickt. Ich werde es so gut wie möglich vermeiden die Schuhe in praller Hitze liegen zu lassen, um die Schrumpfung und Verwindung zu vermeiden. Ich habe das Gefühl das die Hersteller von dern ursprünglichen Materialmischung abgewichen sind. Crocs trage ich seit 8 Jahren. Dieses Problem ist in diesem Umfang neu für mich.Ich bin mir am überlegen ob ich 1 oder 2 Sterne geben soll. Ich gebe jetzt einen Stern, weil ich den Schuh eben meistens in den Sommermonaten trage.

  Il y’a un problème de coïncidence avec la référence Noir (Black) entre la taille sélectionné au moment du choix et la taille qui vous sera livré. Si vous sélectionnez la pointure 42/43 EU (la taille qu’il me fallait) dans le menu déroulant des tailles et que vous l’ajouté au panier, cela vous mettra du 43/44 EU dans le panier et vous serez livré avec du 43/44 EU… donc elles seront trop grande. C’est d’ailleurs la seule taille sélectionnable dans cette plage de taille pour cette couleur. Je m’en suis malheureusement aperçu trop tard et j’ai passé commande. J’ai revérifié plusieurs fois et avec d’autres couleurs et tailles. Il semblerait que ce problème n’est qu’avec cette couleur et cette taille. Ce n’est donc une erreur au niveau de la préparation de la commande mais c’est une erreur informatique au niveau du référencement. Dommage, je vais devoir les retourner et partir sur une autre couleur pour être sûr d’avoir du 42/43 EU.

  Premetto che non sono mai stato un amante di questa scarpa e pertanto le mie valutazioni possono essere inquinate dai miei stessi preconcetti. Ciò detto a dovere di verità,  nulla da eccepire sul servizio di spedizione di Amazon. Avendo un 43 abbondante , ho acquistato per uso domestico con fiducia la misura 43-44 che però ho trovato un po' larga. Non volendo restituire per cambio taglia più piccolo per evitare di ritrovarmi, a detta di chi ha comprato la misura giusta, con un sandalo troppo calzante, ho preferito tenerli. Trovo il prodotto orribile dal design stile infermiere, ma risulta davvero leggero al piede e piacevole con il suo plantare. Trovo anche che si debba calzare necessariamente un calzino anche per casa per evitare che il piede cuocia al suo interno. Non capisco gli entusiasti di questa marca. Buona passeggiata...

  Ich habe mir vor etwa einem halben Jahr ein Paar dieser Crocs bestellt und wollte dann noch ein zweites Paar in derselben Größe und selben Farbe.Als ich das zweite Paar erhielt, habe ich zuerst bemerkt, dass diese um einiges enger geschnitten waren als das Paar mit derselben Größenangabe und mir daher überhaupt nicht passten. Bei genauem Hinsehen und Vergleich fiel mir dann auf, dass sich das neue auch sonst von meinem ""alten"" Paar unterschied. Mein altes Paar war laut Aufdruck Made in Vietnam, das neue Paar Made in Bosnia. Zudem war der neue Farbton dünkler.Offenbar unterscheiden sich die Produkte aus den verschiedenen Herstellerländern doch massiv, daher besteht hier das Risiko, ein für einen ""schlechteres"" Paar zu erwischen, mein zweites Paar ging daher zurück.

Gleiche Form, gleiche Größe, andere Farbe, jetzt Made in Bosnia. Ich habe die Schuhe 3 Wochen während des Campingurlaubs getragen und sie danach in den Schuhschrank zuhause gestellt. Jetzt wollte ich die Schuhe zu Gartenarbeiten anziehen und sie sind so klein geworden, dass ich nicht mehr hineinkomme.Ich wollte die Schuhe zurück schicken, das geht aber nicht mehr, da ich ein paar Tage zu spät gemerkt habe, dass die Schuhe jetzt nur noch eine Kindergröße haben.

  Prese per sostituire un vecchio paio ormai pieno di crepe sul davanti. La taglia era quella che cercavo (consiglio di usare la tabella di conversione come riferimento, ad esempio un 42/43 EU corrisponde ad un 9-11 US), il modello Classic in particolare calza un po' abbondante. La confezione non è il massimo, visto che sono arrivate in una busta di plastica trasparente semi-aperta senza alcuna scritta, quindi consiglio di lavarle o pulirle con delle salviette igienizzanti prima di utilizzarle. Quelle da me ordinate risultano essere Made in Italy e rispetto al prezzo di listino in negozio ho risparmiato all'incirca il 33%

  De zapatos calzo un 42 de talla, vivo en España. Compré la talla 41-42 de color NEGRO, que es equivalente a unas 10-12 porque ya tenía unas blancas con esa talla, pero compradas en una tienda física. Me llegaron y como se ve en la fotografía hay mucha diferencia con la misma talla, me quedan muy pequeñas.Pensé que lo mismo estaban mal mis anteriores blancas, es muy raro que el mismo fabricante cambie tanto de talla y las he utilizado sin cerrar por detrás.El tema es que compré a mi mujer otras en otro vendedor de color ROSA talla 39-40 que es el equivalente a ellos 7-9 y pude comprobar que incluso son más grandes que las que compré 41-42.Al final se ha quedado mi mujer con las negras porque no hay nada peor que ir con un calzado pequeño.Es decir son las tallas de este vendedor las que son más pequeñas que las otras y eso quiere decir que o están mal rotuladas o no son auténticas

  Nach den gemischten Rezensionen hier und den offenbar großen Qualitätsunterschieden, war ich unsicher, ob es eine gute Idee ist, die Crocs online zu kaufen.Tatsächlich bin ich aber sehr begeistert. Ich hatte bisher nur einmal eine Billigkopie gekauft, die ich auch ein Jahr lang gerne getragen habe. Allerdings war die Sohle so dünn, dass man kaum auf steinigem Boden gehen konnte. Kein Vergleich zu den Crocs - die haben eine schön dicke Sohle und fühlen sich am Fuß ganz anders an, richtig angenehm darin auch weite Strecken zu gehen. Ich habe seit ich die Crocs habe keine anderen Schuhe mehr getragen, außer bei Regen.Ich habe ein Paar ""made in Italy"" erwischt - diese Variante würde ich also auf jeden Fall empfehlen.

  Très déçue par cette commande ""bleu navy"" que j'ai renvoyée car c'était de fausses crocs, made in china, trop grandes, trop larges, dures, inconfortables alors que le plastique des vraies crocs est souple et doux. Auparavant j'avais commandé une paire d'un autre bleu, à peine plus cher, made in italy, très agréable au pied mais un peu trop petite (38-39). Je croyais donc recevoir le même modèle dans la taille au-dessus (39-40). Hélas non. Dans ce modèle de crocs, c'est la loterie. On ne peut se fier ni à la taille, ni au prix. Dommage, je me passerai de crocs car je ne veux pas courir le risque une troisième fois!

Ich zieh sie jetzt sogar in meiner Wohnung oft gar nicht mehr aus und erwäge daher, der Hygiene wegen, noch ein paar anzuschaffen.Die Dinger sind natürlich keine Sicherheitsstiefel, und außer Haus würd ich damit nicht herumlaufen.

  By now it's not news for me to say that these are comfy and super light. The little nubs on the insole are nice.But buy a half-size smaller or even a full size. Unless you're getting these because you require a LOT of empty space in your shoe, these are really roomy and kinda flop around as you walk. The strap keeps them on your feet, though.

Unico appunto: io la stringa non la tengo dietro alla caviglia, per comodità di indossarle ""al volo"", quindi la tengo in avanti: in questa posizione devo dire però che ogni tanto la stringa esce e si appoggia sul collo del piede e bisogna rimetterla apposto... la toglierei ma non si può.

  Habe mir und meinem Mann die Crocs in unterschiedlichen Farben und Größen bestellt. Gedacht waren die Crocs für den Garten. Zu Hause angekommen, haben uns die Crocs gleich zugesagt. Diese waren von Anfang an bequem und die Farben passten auch. Sind genau wie im Internet abgebildet. Haben diese von Anfang an auf der Terrasse gelassen. Mit der Zeit sind diese vermutlich durch die Sonneneinstrahlung leider 1-2 Größen kleiner geworden, sodass uns diese nicht mehr gepasst haben. Farbe hat sich jedoch gar nicht verändert. Finde das ziemlich schade, da diese eigentlich bequem waren. Nun sind wir auf normale FilpFlops umgestiegen.

Pero recomiendo comprar tu talla habitual.Lo que sí noté es que son muy anchos, después te acostumbras, pero si tienes el pie estrecho como yo, al principio piensas que se te van a salir.Después de unos días de uso, me parecen tan cómodos como dicen.

Quedan perfectos según la talla española, aunque creo que es conveniente un poco más grandes de manera que el dedo se pueda mover arriba y abajo y quede un espacio; ¿para qué? porque son más cómodos y porque si se ponen calcetines tipo trecking de invierto quedan más sueltos y no apretados. Sin embargo en los anteriores el tallaje era otro, el 6-8 mientras que éstos, que son el 7-9 son más pequeños... Así que cuidado con las tallas; los ya usuarios no tendrán problema.

  Tenía un esguince y el pie hinchado como bola por lo que me era muy difícil usar zapatos , así que decidí buscar unos crocs y los amoooo . Ahora los crocs son mi calzado favorito para ver series , descansar e incluso para el Home Office XD.Lo pros:-  La calidad y el material son muy buenos.- El precio, elegí los importados a $760 aprox . En México se consiguen siempre arriba de mil .- Son los originales- Son anchos. Los puedes usar solos o con calcetas, sin duda serán cómodos para personas con el pie ancho.- Son cómodos . Tengo un problema ya que al usar chanclas planas por horas hace que  me duelan los talones. Con los crocs no pasa eso  ya que tiene soporte para el arco y una buena forma para la suela. Puedo traerlos todo el día .- Colores sólidos y fáciles de lavar- Llegaron antes de lo estimado- TIP para la Talla correcta. En mi caso solo me fijé en la talla que uso en un calzado que ya viene en talla Europea o americana y pedí esa misma para los crocs .

  Il materiale appare poco morbido rispetto ad altre Crocs made in Italy, comunque il rapporto qualità/prezzo sembra buono considerati la taglia ed il colore per un costo (scontato) inferiore ai 20 euro.

  Ogni tanto cado in tentazione e acquisto le gemelle cinesi...... ma niente da mettere in confronto con l'originale! Ottimo prezzo, ottima calzata (il numero viene rispettato non serve prendere numeri più grandi), ottimo materiale e cosa che forse non tutti sanno queste ciabatte non puzzano neanche dopo settimane senza lavarle!!!! Non parlo dell'odore di plastica che nella concorrenza a volte è davvero sgradevole, ma proprio dell'odore che si può creare portandole quotidianamente per ore.Unica cosa contro è il tipo di plastica. Ho acquistato questo modello x me (39/40) e uno uguale solo di colore diverso (ultraviolet) per mia figlia (37/38). Non so per quale motivo quelle di mia figlia sono più morbide sia al tatto che indossandole. Sembra proprio un'altra plastica.Comunque ottimo prodotto, indistruttibile e molto comodo.

  Calzo come numero tra il 38 e 38,5 dipendente dal modello, per cui ho PRESO le CROCS 37/38 e SONO PERFETTE.Inizialmente avevo preso il 38/39 ed erano grandi, scappavano dal piede, anche indossate con il centurino dietro che le tenevano un po' più ferme, erano troppo abbondanti,  e poi non mi piaceva che la forma del mio piede non combaciasse con la leggera forma del plantare.Il 37/ 38 per una calzata  di  38 - 38.5  È PERFETTA.Non è ovviamente una calzatura avvolgente, è molto comoda, e deve piacere il tipo di calzatura.L'ho presa essenzialmente perché ho un piede fratturato in fase di guarigione e non riuscivo a calzare niente da far entrare il mio piede un po' gonfio, e queste Crocs vanno benissimo, sia con l'altro piede sano, sia con questo un po' più gonfio.Ho in casa una sottomarca tipo Crocs, che fin'ora ho calzato tranquillamente, ma devo ammettere che la differenza tra le mie anonime calzature e le originali Crocs è evidente.Le prime sono di semplice plastica,  un po' più rigide, calzano anche più avvolgenti e il costo è decisamente inferiore... le seconde, le Crocs, sono tutt'altro genere, di gomma, molto morbide, più ampie, comode.Mi piace la morbidezza di queste ultime, e mi piace indossarle con le calze, i fantasmini.

Ma con mia grande sorpresa dopo un paio di giorni le ho trovate eccezionali e non vorrei mai più toglierle. Si sino rivelate di una comodità inaudita, leggere e il piede è più riposato. Finalmente una ciabatta/zoccola a pianta larga con un plantare della adeguata durezza. Sono realizzate in materiale plastico brevettato denominato EVA che permette una robustezza, leggerezza, elasticità adeguata e costante, senza cattivi odori, e garantisce comunque la traspirazione del piede. La taglie è leggermente più abbondante del solito ma secondo me non in lunghezza ma in larghezza essendo a pianta larga. Se le provate, non potrete più farne a meno!!

  Le croce vestono un numero in più di quello abituale o mezzo numero, dipende da dove viene fabbricato. Io ho preso un 37/38 e io uso sempre il 37 nonostante io abbia un 36 e messo di piede ma forse io non faccio testo perché dereste le scarpe e le ciabatte strette e mi prendo sempre un numero in più per starci comoda e non pressata. Quindi dipende un po’ da ognuno. Uno che non ha mai acquistato le crocs magari per non sbagliarsi sul numero è meglio che se le provi prima in negozio e poi magari le compri qua per evitare di sbagliare numero. Per il resto io mi son trovata bene nonostante ho un piede mooooolto delicato. All inizio fanno strano quei puntini sotto la suola ma poi alla fine ci si abitua, sono molto leggere e le puoi lavare spesso quindi le trovo molto più igieniche delle normali pantofole.

  Muy contenta con los crocs. Los utiliza mi hijo de 10 años para estar en casa, ya que las zapatillas de toda la vida le dan siempre mucho calor. Desde que descubrió los crocs ya no hay marcha atrás. Él acaba de pasar del número 36 al 37, y le he cogido la 38-39 para que le duren un poco más. Como es natural le quedan holgados pero tampoco exagerados. Y siempre se puede utilizar la tira trasera de ajuste aunque a él no le gusta, prefiere sentir el pie suelto. Son blanditos, cómodos y no pesan nada. Hasta ahora tenía unos con motivos infantiles, pero a partir de determinado número ya son de adulto, sin filigranas. ¡Eso le ha dado un poco de pena!

  Schneller Versandt, sind bequem zu tragen. Nutze sie im Garten für mehr nicht. Aber, die letzten Crocs gingen ein, also wurden kleiner. Grund war das stehenlassen auf der Terrasse in der prallen Sonne. Okay, jetzt könnte jemand sage, selber schuld, kein Wunder das die kleiner werden, aber darauf möchte ich folgendes sagen. In den 70iger und 80iger Jahren standen Adiletten in den Schwimmbädern oder daheim auch immer im Freien und wurden mE nicht kleiner. Was war da anders ?Nachtrag.Die Dinger sind jetzt 4 Wochen da und ich habe darauf geachtet, dass sie nicht in der Sonne stehen. Der rechte Schuh ist nun mind 2 Nummern kleiner geworden.Also, nicht in der prallen Sonne stehen lassen, ich kann keine Kaufempfehlung geben, kaufe mir in Zukunft irgendeinen Billigschuh dann muss man sich wenigstens nicht ärgern.

  Lo que más me preocupaba era dar con la talla, y he acertado. Calzo un 43 y pedí un 43/44. Dudaba entre un 42/43 o un 43/44 ya que no quería que me quedasen excesivamente grandes pero me quedan perfectos! Si hubiese pedido un 42/43 creo que el borde de atrás me hubiese molestado ya que se levanta un poco. Al ser tipo zuecos, me preocupaba si iban a hacer ruido al andar pero no es el caso ya que son de goma y no hacen nada de ruido. No sé si en pleno verano me darán mucho calor en los pies ya que son de goma y un poco cerrados. Pero, en definitiva, muy buena compra ya que son comodísimos!

  Was sich erstmal schlecht liest, ist in Wahrheit nicht schlecht! Der Schuh ist nun wirklich nicht schön, das muss man zugeben. Aber um Schöhnheit geht es hier auch nicht. Dafür ist er sehr bequem und leicht, hält auch ohne Felleinsatz angenehm warm und man kann ihn überall gebrauchen (Garten, als Hausschuh, Hochzeitsfeiern, Disco, uvm.). Er lässt einen nie in Stich. Ebenso kann man diese Schuhe auch super mit milder Seife, einem Tuch und Wasser reinigen und danach sofort wieder anziehen. Einfach hässlich aber praktisch. Eben wie ein Fiat Multipla.Zur Größe: Ich trage Gr. 36 und habe mir 36/37 bestellt. Passt wie Popo auf Eimer. Ein wenig weit sind Crocs ja immer, aber der Schuh rutscht trotzdem nicht vom Fuß. Man sollte halt drauf achten, dass man nicht die weite Vatiante bestellt, außer man hat auch Gr. 36 in der Breite.Zur Farbe: Geil.Zum Material: Da ich sorgsam mit meinen Sachen umgehe, mussten meine geliebten Hausschuhe nie in der Sonne schmoren und sind daher noch wie neu. Von schrumpfen weiß ich nichts.

  Las he comprado en gris y están bien. Aun así tengo dudas de que sean originales, sobretodo porque en ambos zapatos está el resto de la boquilla de inyección en la parte de la puntera de la suela, cosa rara y que no tenían ninguna de las crocs que había tenido anteriormente. Eso, sumado al tamaño (misma talla que las anteriores, pero me baila bastante más el pie) me hace sospechar de una imitación. Me las quedo porque no me van mal, pero no estoy lo contento que estaba con todas las otras.

  Sono comode a tal punto che indossare le Nike dopo averle portate fa sembrare le Nike dure! Io indosso il 40 (di Nike anche 41) ed ho preso un 39/40 di Crocs, perfette! Unica pecca per chi ha il piede molto magro come me, è il fatto che sono davvero larghe e quindi è necessario indossarle con il cinturino abbassato dietro il tallone altrimenti fuggono. Però comodissime! Per la durata non so dire perché le ho appena acquistate.

Sie sind etwas länger als nötig, aber nur minimal. Ich brauche normalerweise Weite G / H und sie passen einwandfrei. Enger dürften sie nicht sein, deshalb bin ich froh dass ich mich für 50/51 statt 49/50 entschieden habe.

Daher geht der Schuh (leider) zurück.Nun habe ich die Crocks in Größe 37/38 bestellt. Diese sind made in ""Vietnam"". Allerdings auch hier, ein neutraler Geruch und ansonsten gut verarbeitet.

  Vorwort: Die Crocs wurden als Geschenk von mir, für mich zu Weihnachten gekauft.Versand: Typisch Amazon gab es einen schnellen Versand ohne sonstige Probleme.Verpackung: Die Schuhe waren in einem Karton ordentlich verpackt. Es gab keine Kaputten stellen o.ä.Produkt: Bestellt wurden die Schuhe in der Größe 42/43 in der Farbe Grau, da sie in Schwarz nicht mehr in der richtigen Größe lieferbar waren.Allerdings ist das garnicht schlimm da sie in Grau sehr gut aussehen. Ich konnte keine Verarbeitungsfehler oder einen unangenehmen Geruch feststellen.Also schnell die Füße rein und die ersten "" geh versuche "" gemacht. Sitzt wie angegossen. In üblichen Straßenschuhe habe ich eine 42-43.Ein wichtiger Kaufgrund für die Hausschuhe waren auch der Schutz meiner Füße vor einem Siebenschläfer, gefangen in einem 45 Kg schwerem Hundekörper. Da er gerne mal Pfote trifft Fuß spielt, schützen diese Schuhe nicht nur vor Fußbodenkälte sondern auch gegen übereifrige Sabberschnuten.Pro:+Guter Tragekomfort+Angenehm dicke Sohle+Schutz gegen HundepfotenContra:- Socken können aufgrund des Schuhmaterials verrutschenFazit:Zusammenfassend kann ich den Schuh empfehlen. Gerade für Menschen die auf der Arbeit leichtes Schuhwerk tragen können ( Pfleger, Ärzte etc.), sehe ich hier einen hervorragenden Schuh mit tollem Preis/Leistungsverhältnis.

  Molti mi hanno sempre parlato bene di queste ciabatte/pantofole ma per una questione estetica le ho sempre snobbate. In effetti sono bruttissime ma mi sono convinto a prenderle perché ho letto che sono tra le poche a non lasciare quegli agglomerati di polvere neri per terra che mi stavano facendo diventare pazzo. Lavavo a terra e dopo poche ore spuntavano di nuovo e la suola delle mie vecchie ciabatte ne era piena.Devo dire che le Crocs funzionano egregiamente in questo ed inoltre sono comodissime, super morbide. Io che indosso solitamente il 46 ho preso 46/47 a pianta regolare e vanno benissimo. Magari in estate faranno sudare un po' il piede ma essendo un unico pezzo di gomma si lavano e asciugano facilmente .Le consiglio assolutamente molto se siete disposti a mettere da parte l'aspetto estetico in favore della funzionalità.

  Ho comprato questi sabot per utilizzarli in ufficio durante la stagione estiva. Premetto che non amo indossare le scarpe aperte e che detesto i sandali, quindi nella scena di questo tipo di articolo sono stato molto meticoloso. Ho scelto Crocs dopo aver consultato diverse persone che le acquistano da tempo, si tratta anche di professionisti, come farmacisti, che le indossano quotidianamente sul lavoro e che hanno bisogno di comfort,stando in piedi per tanto tempo. Sono molto soddisfatto della mia scelta. Dal punto di vista pratico, l'articolo è molto leggero, il laccetto posteriore evita che il sabot slitti mentre si cammina. La suola interna è dotata di grip che favorisce l'aderenza e pratica anche un lieve massaggio. In colore blu scuro è di una tonalità che favorisce l'abbinamento ad abbigliamento informale. Io indosso spesso i jeans, quindi l'abbinamento rimane discreto e non attira l'attenzione di chi è abituato ad indossare le scarpe.I fori sulla tomaia garantiscono una eccellente aerazione. A fine giornata vi faranno rimpiangere di dover indossare le scarpe per tornare a casa. Ottimo acquisto!

  calzano giusti e sono molto comodi, come già scritto da molti acquirenti. Un punto di attenzione però: le scarne istruzioni arrivate con il mio acquisto Made in Bosnia (non incluso L italiano ) riportano solo avvertenze per la camminata, per esempio sulle scale ( in ogni caso corretto, sicurezza innanzi tutto). Dopo aver lasciato i crocs all’aperto esposti al sole ho constatato con stupore Il loro restringimento , ma non di poco! Su internet ho poi trovato che sulla pagina web -in inglese-  del costruttore effettivamente si raccomanda di EVITARE di lasciare i crocs esposti al sole o al caldo, per evitare appunto il fenomeno di  contrazione delle  molecole che costituiscono queste simpatiche calzature. Quindi non lasciateli al sole pieno estivo !

Ligeras, se lavan fácil y se secan en poco tiempo, con calcetines las puedes llevar como zapatillas de estar en casa en invierno. Al principio el dibujo en la planta hace que sea un poco molesto pero en dos días dejas de notarlo.Las compré de oferta por 18€, eso sí, tenían que ser amarillas. Dicen que la calidad depende de la fábrica, las mías son made in bosnia y ninguna queja.

  Sebbene vi sia una certa differenza tra un paio di Crocs classic di cinque anni fa con quelle Classic di adesso (colori diversi) a favore di quelle di prima, queste ""ciabatte da mare"" mantengono sempre una certa funzionalità, robustezza e  resistenza all'usura. Non scivolano sul bagnato anche se, dato l'uso continuo che ne faccio, ne possiedo un paio apparentemente in buone condizioni, in cui - se bagnate all'interno - il piede non fa presa sulla ciabatta e il rischio di scivolare a terra è concreto. Le consiglio comunque.

  Hatte mir das gleiche Paar schon mal vor einiger Zeit als Warehouseartikel gekauft, da war seltsamer Weise die rechte Pantolette bestimmt 3-4 Nummer kleiner, obwohl da auch 50/51 drauf stand. Habe mir das Paar jetzt noch mal normal gekauft und da stimmt alles, die Haltbarkeit ist auch gegeben. Voriges Jahr hatte ich mir schon ein Paar in einer anderen Farbe gekauft und das tut immer noch das, was es soll. Es ist zwar schon etwas ausgetreten aber immer noch im Rahmen des normalen Verschleißes und ich bin ja wirklich kein Hunger-haken und belastet die Pantoletten dem entsprechend.

  I love these shoes.  I have tendon issues from the knee to tip of toes and these shoes are what allows me pain free days.  Love them.  I only wear them as house shoes and not worn outside the home ever.  No real support for walking outside but indoors as slippers or house shoes, excellent!  This is about my 10 th pair over the years and crocs are the best on the market.  Many other brands available but trust me I guarantee that crocs are the only brand worth buying!!

  Der Schuh ist wirklich gemütlich. Ich trage die Crocs täglich bei der Arbeit in einer Kindertagesstätte. Durch die Löcher findet andauernd eine Luftzirkulation statt, weshalb ich immer schön warme, aber keine schwitzigen Füße habe. Auf nassem Boden hat man einen guten Halt und die Füße bleiben trocken, es sei denn es tropft was durch eins der Löcher.Sie lassen sich einfach mit einem feuchten Tuch reinigen. Wenn man mal Barfuß im Schuh war, lässt sich der Croc auch von Innen einfach mit Desinfektionsmittel reinigen.Der Riemen an der Ferse sorgt für zusätzlichen Halt beim Gehen. Die Farbe ist außerdem super cool und schaut aus wie auf den Bildern.

  Nachdem ich die Schuhe auf dem Balkon ausgezogen habe, lag der linke für ca. 1 Stunde in der Sonne und ist dabei ca um eine Nummer geschrumpft, während der rechte im Schatten lag und Originalgröße hat. Es wäre noch nicht mal so schlimm, wenn er sich vielleicht nun wieder beim Tragen dehnt, aber nun ist er auch eine Nummer kürzer und man steht ständig auf dem Fersenteil. Davon abgesehen wirkt auch der nicht geschrumpfte Schuh nach einem Monat des Tragens als Hausschuh schon irgendwie ausgelatscht. Das waren meine ersten und letzten Paar Crocs. Für den Preis ist die Qualität meiner Meinung nach auf keinen Fall ausreichend und daher nicht empfehlenswert.

  le Croc's hanno una qualità superiore alle imitazioni da pochi euro, io le uso già da tempo e si mantengono inalterate per anni, in più su amazon le ho trovate allo stesso prezzo delle imitazioni, quindi meglio di così! Calzano giusto, leggermente sul grande che sul piccolo, consiglio di prendere un numero mezzo in più.Perfette per chi ha problemi di male ai piedi perchè sono molto morbide. L'unico ""difetto"" è che essendo sintetiche fanno sudare il piede se le si usa senza calze per molto tempo. Si puliscono in un attimo con acqua e sapone.

  Ho acquistato le Crocs per avere una calzatura comoda e confortevole durante la mia degenza in ospedale. Effettivamente è un ottimo prodotto confortevole con una gomma morbida e all'interno una superficie puntiforme sagomata che stimola il massaggio plantare. Unica osservazione negativa, stinge il colore interno alla calzatura sui fantasmini. Può darsi che la cosa sia dovuta al fatto che sono nuove.. ma sinceramente ci sono rimasto un pò male su questo particolare altrimenti avrei dato 5 stelle di valutazione.

  Ich trage immer M7 W9 = EU 39/40 (meine eigentliche Schuhgröße ist EU 40.)Meine früheren originalen Crocs von 2008 haben immer gepasst und tun sie auch noch, nur eben inzwischen alt und vom Profil abgelaufen, produziert in Italien.Gestern in navy blau erhalten (made in Mexico), gleiche Größe: sind minimal kleiner, und auch bisschen weiter.Gesamtlänge: 27cminnen: 25,5cmGesamtbreite: 11cmSiehe FotoGeruch: nicht so penetrant chemisch, wie hier oft prophezeit wird. Es geht noch. Wird sicher verschwinden.Material: fühlt sich härter an, als meine alten Crocs. Die Noppen sind deutlich zu spüren beim laufen. Meine Frau hat sich für paar Euro genau solche Schuhe im Euro Shop gekauft: vom Material und der Form kaum Unterschiede.Die alten Crocs federn mehr, es läuft sich weicher.Da sie nicht passen und ich vorn anstoße, beim laufen, muß ich doch eine Nummer größer bestellen.Nachtrag: Größe 41/42: etwas zu groß, aber da sie wohl auch einlaufen können, lieber etwas größer bestellen, als zu klein. Ebenfalls aus Mexiko.Gesamtlänge: 28cminnen: 26,5cmGesamtbreite: 11,3cmFazit: wenn diese Crocs wirklich so einlaufen, wie prophezeit, dann stimmt hier das Preis/Leistungsverhältnis nicht mehr. Dann reichen auch Billig Imitate für 1-3€. Oder man kauft Sie im Schuhladen, achtet auf Made in Italy und probiert so lange, bis man die richtige Größe hat. z.B. Zwischengrößen. 41.

  In generale buon prodotto, integro e di normale fattura. Rispetto al modello che già possedevo acquistato alcuni anni fa che riportava sulla suola la dicitura made in Italy, questo paio, che invece riporta la scritta made in Bosnia, è costituito da gomma più dura e risulta quindi meno confortevole. Nel complesso comunque risulta un buon acquisto.

  Se ajustan muy bien al pie, yo uso una 36 normalmente y los de la talla 36/37 me quedan perfectos y aunque queda un poco de espacio no siento que se me vayan a salir los pies y se ajustan estupendamente.Me paso muchas horas de pie y son lo mejor que he probado hasta ahora así que espero que me duren mucho tiempo.El material no es un plástico duro, si no mas bien como gomaespuma y hace que sean muy cómodos

  Ich trage seit einigen Jahren Crocs eigentlich nur im Haus. Nachdem bei meinem letzten Paar das Profil von der Sohle abgelaufen war, mussten ein Paar neue her. Profil in der Sohle im Haus ist ja nicht so wichtig, könnte man meinen, aber wer schon einmal nach dem Bodenwischen eine Schlitterpartie hingelegt hat, sieht das vielleicht anders. Die abgelaufen Crocs habe ich im Schuhladen um die Ecke gekauft, und ich als Schuhgröße 45-Träger brauchte da schon die Größe UK12. Ins Deutsche übersetzt heisst das Schuhgröße 46/47! Wenn man das weiß, kommt man damit ja auch zurecht, aber exakt die UK12 ist mir bei den jetzt gelieferten Crocs in grau fast zu klein. Wenn man hier ein bisschen in den Rezensionen stöbert wird schnell klar, dass die Schuhe nicht in der Sonne stehen sollen und auch sonst gerne mal schrumpfen, aber...Ich hoffe jetzt mal, dass sie nicht noch viel kleiner werden, als es die Schuhgröße suggeriert, und ich bin auch sehr zufrieden mit den Schuhen, aber die Passgenauigkeit macht ein Onlinekauf fast unmöglich.

  Ho il 41, il 41/42 è leggermente troppo corto, il 42/43 è enorme. Usate all'aperto entro poche settimane si sono ristrette perdendo almeno una taglia, a quel punto mi sono diventate giuste. Le ciabatte sarebbero molto comode, ma tra taglie strane e il fatto che il materiale non è stabile e si restringe direi che preferisco rimanere sui cloni da supermercato a 8 euro.

  Compre a mi madre estos zuecos hace dos meses.Ella ha tenido en los últimos años mucho dolor en la planta de los pies y le han hecho varias infiltraciones.Siempre le costaba encontrar unos zapatos cómodos y que ademas le sirvieran para cualquier sitio.Desde que se los regale anda super contenta. Hace tiempo que no le duelen los pies. Podemos hacer excursiones y caminatas y ella feliz. Cosa que hace unos meses hubiera sido impensable.- No huele, muy resistentes, fáciles de limpiar.Otra cosa. Cuando os lo envian pueden estar fabricados en Europa o en México. Los que recibio mi madre son los mexicanos y como digo tras dos meses de prueba van perfectos. La calidad es la misma.----------------------------------Ojo!! El único problema que tuvimos es que la talla le quedo grande. Los tallajes van de dos en dos 36/37 y 37/38 por ejemplo. Yo le compre en su día los 37/38 y le quedaron grandes por lo que tuvimos que optar por la devolución y volver a pedir los 36/37. Siempre ir a por el tallaje pequeño ya que por lo visto sino os pueden quedar grandes.

  Ho acquistato la misura 36-37 per un piede 36,5 e risultano leggermente lunghe: sono assolutamente utilizzabili (infatti non le cambierò), ma per un 36, a mio parere, sono al limite, soprattutto per l’ampiezza della calzata. Per il resto, solo di una comodità incredibile, leggerissime. Possiedo già il modello “Bistro” (senza buchi) e questo classico è senza dubbio più largo ma anche più leggero.

  Per l'utilizzo casalingo invernale sono il massimo, perfetto isolamento termico dal pavimento e massimo comfort, finchè non le provi non puoi sapere quanto sono comode, anche per lunghe ore di utilizzo in piedi.

  Ich trage meine Crocs in der Arbeit seit nun mittlerweile seit ca. 3 Jahren. Wir haben schon einige Kilometer gemeinsam geschafft und jederzeit würde ich sie wieder kaufen. Sie sind unkompliziert, einfach zu reinigen (ich putze sie im Waschbecken mit Seife oder Geschirrspülmittel) und angenehm zu tragen. Lediglich im Sommer, wenn ich überall und an den Füßen schwitze, beginnen sie zu stinken. Aber welche nichtatmungsaktiven Kunststoffschlapfen die man 30 Stunden am Stück trägt, tun das nicht. Ich persönlich habe einen hohen Wrist und generell große Füße, beim nächsten Mal möchte ich sie mir eine Größe größer kaufen, da ich denke, dass ich somit auch das Müffelproblem loswerde (da sich die Löcher vorne und an den Seiten auszahlen werden. Derzeit liegt mein Fuß an)

  Nach Verlust in unserem Urlaub 2 Paar hier käuflich erworben. Das war ein Fehler, denn jetzt liegen beide Paare nach noch nicht mal einem halben Sommer in der Restmülltonne. Zuerst kann man es gar nicht glauben, aber durch Wärme und Sonneneinstrahlung haben sich alle vier schwarzen Crocs völlig verformt und passen gar nicht mehr. Woraus sie bestehen und woher sie kommen mag ich mir nicht vorstellen - es können jedoch nicht Original-Crocs sein. So etwas habe ich noch nicht erlebt. Nicht kaufen. Wir haben jetzt direkt beim Originalhersteller bestellt und beobachten die Entwicklung.

  Der Schuh hat eine gute ergonomische Form, ist genug flexibel um die Fußbewegung mitzumachen und die Sohle ist ziemlich weich,  was gut dämpft.Ich suchte einen Hausschuh, der für Holztreppen geeignet ist. Sollte bequem sein, Holztreppen nicht beschädigen (die Kanten) und leise sein wenn man die Treppen runter eilt.Ich war überall,  Reno, Deichmann, Geier usw.Sohle zu hart und unflexibel.Der crocs war die einzige Wahl.Dieses Modell und made in Italy war z.B. besser als Made in China, da die Ferse angenehmer ist.Die neueren Modell sind vorne alle enger, was für mehr Wärme sorgt im sommer.Für mich die beste Wahl.1 Stern abzug, da es in dem Material nach einer Weile trotzdem warm wird und man die Schuhe ausziehen muss. 1 Minute lüftet und es geht wieder.

  Ich bin zufrieden mit meinem Kauf, für 21€ kann man nichts falsch machen. Allerdings sieht das rot auf dem Produktbild frischer und leuchtender aus, in der Realität ist der Farbton eher ein ziegelrot. Ich habe Schuhgröße 45 und habe den Schuh in der Doppelgröße 45/46 bestellt. Ich finde die Größe ist sehr knapp, jemand mit Schuhgröße 46 wird keine Freude damit haben. Habe den Schuh dennoch behalten, mir passt er und ich würde ihn wieder kaufen.

  Il mio fisioterapista mi ha consigliato di acquistare le crocs per una fascite plantare al metatarso, dopo nemmeno 24 ore che le indossavo già avvertivo meno dolore, non ci credevo nemmeno io! Inoltre sebbene sia una scarpa molto chiusa avevo paura che mi facesse sudare i piedi, invece rimangono freschissimi. Forse è un po' troppo larga, ma io ho il piede molto magro e quindi forse avrei dovuto acquistare il modello più stretto, ho visto che ce ne sono.. comunque sono soddisfattissimo, non le abbandonerò più, da ora in poi solo Crocs!!!!

Daher war das erste Paar in Größe 39/40 leider zu klein, ich habe Gr. 40. Der Umtausch war problemlos, habe dann EU Gr. 41/42 bestellt. Passen super, auch noch mit dickeren Socken im Winter. Ob sie bei Wärme im Sommer ""schrumpfen"" will ich nicht hoffen. Bei denen die ich hatte, blieb die Größe unverändert, obwohl ich sie bei 30 Grad in der Sonne hab stehen lassen.

  Ich habe mir die Crocs in Blau / Navy 410 Anfang des Jahres gekauft, um sie zu einem etwa sechsmonatigen Wanderurlaub mit Rucksack in den USA mitzunehmen, um sie dort im Camp, in Hostels (auch zum Duschen) und zum Durchwaten von Flüssen einzusetzen. Für diesen Zweck eignen sich die Schuhe hervorragend aus folgenden Gründen.- Auf so einer Reise möchte man möglichst wenig Gewicht mit sich rumschleppen. Die Crocs sind relativ leicht und lassen sich (z.B. mit kleinen Karabinern) sehr gut außen am Rucksack befestigen. Vor dem Kauf habe ich leider nirgendwo eine Angabe über das genaue Gewicht gefunden. Falls es noch jemanden interessiert: In Größe 45/46 wiegen beide Crocs zusammen 396g. Da die Schuhe kein Wasser aufsaugen, muss man sich auch bei Regen nicht drum kümmern, wenn man sie außen an einem wasserdichten Rucksack befestigt hat.- Flüsse mit kaltem Wasser und glitschigen Steinen sollte man nicht barfuß durchwaten. Die Crocs eignen sich dafür sehr gut, da man durch die flexibel vor- und zurückklappbare ""Halterung"" hinter der Ferse nicht Gefahr läuft, dass sie von der Strömung einfach vom Fuß gespült werden. Auch im Alltag ist diese ""Halterung"" ziemlich praktisch. Wenn sie nach vorne geklappt ist, kann man einfacher reinschlüpfen und sie wie Badelatschen verwenden, wenn man mehr Halt braucht, kann man sie auch zurückklappen. Die Sohle ist ziemlich stabil, sodass man keine Angst haben muss, wenn man auf spitze Steine o.ä. tritt. Da die Schuhe einfach nur aus Kunststoff bestehen, saugen sie kein Wasser auf und sind schnell wieder trocken.- Man kann die Crocs in Hostels mit teilweise etwas dreckigen Duschen wunderbar auch beim Duschen anziehen.- Die Schuhe sind sehr robust. Sie wurden von mir sechs Monate lang fast jeden Tag im freien auf oft steinigem / felsigem Grund eingesetzt, bei Temperaturen von 35° und bei Temperaturen von 0°, bei Regen und bei Sonne und sie sind immer noch unbeschadet.Mittlerweile bin ich wieder zurück in Deutschland. Die Crocs haben einiges mitgemacht in den letzten Monaten, sehen aber immernoch fast wie neu aus. Da mein ausgedehnter Urlaub also zu Ende ist, nutze ich sie jetzt einfach als Hausschuhe - dafür finde ich sie auch sehr praktisch.Meine Crocs sind übrigens ""made in China"", aber sie stinken nicht und sind auch (trotz Einsatz in knalliger Hitze und Sonne im Sommer) nicht geschrumpft.

  The product and colour are so nice and genuine. The only problem is I was ordered size M6W8 as it available at the moment and it's my exact size that I usually use but the product delivered to me by size M7W9, so it is a bit big for me but I don't have time to get its exchange so I decided that a bit bigger than my size is okay.

  Paire de ""Crocs"" achetée pour remplacer une paire équivalente qui commence à se faire vieille.- Première déception : avec exactement la même taille, celles-ci taillent plus petit que mon ancienne paire. Elles me vont mais juste juste.- Deuxième déception : le matériau. Alors que mon ancienne est réalisée dans un composite mou et mat, très agréable à porter, celles-ci sont moulées dans un composite dur et brillant. On dirait une copie achetée à 3 balles dans un magasin de hard-discount. Donc, dans ces conditions, la prochaine fois je les achète à 3 balles dans un magasin de hard-discount. Au revoir, Croc.

  Warum habe ich den Croc erworben?Ich wollte einen Schuh haben den ich in den Eingangsbereich meiner Wohnung stellen kann meine Schuhe ausziehen kann und direkt etwas Bequemes zum reinschlüpfen habe.Die meisten Pantoffeln die ich vorher hatte konnte man nicht einfach zum reinschlüpfen verwenden, dieser Croc ist aber weit genug um aus seinen Schuhen auszusteigen und hier direkt einzusteigenAbgesehen davon ist er Super Bequem und sehr sehr leichtEinziges Manko, dadurch das er aus Gummi ist, klebt es etwas bei Schwitzigen Füßen ohne SockenAber das war mir vorher klar.Er eignet sich auch Optimal als Gartenschuh oder für kurze Gänge wie zum Bäcker etc.Ich werde mir wohl noch 1-2 bestellen :)

  Für Haus und Garten ein optimaler Schuh. Barfuß haben die Noppen einen angenehmen Massageeffekt. Sie sind schön leicht.Einziger Minuspunkt!: Lässt man sie mal draußen stehen, was in meinen Augen bei Gummischuhen ja machbar sein sollte, machen sie die Temperaturunterschiede und das Wetter nicht mit und können sie ordentlich einlaufen. (ein Schuh ist von 43 auf 40 eingelaufen) Den Preis finde ich eigentlich etwas übertrieben für die Materialkosten.

  Wer Crocs kennt und sie auch mal getragen hat wird sie lieben oder hassen.Wir gehören zu ersteren. Die Schuhe sind leicht und bequem. Man kann sie im Sommer ohne und im Winter mit Socken tragen. Durch die großzügige Belüftung wird ein starkes Schwitzen der Füße vermieden. Die Crocs sind außerdem sehr leicht wodurch sie angenehm zu laufen sind.Wir benutzen sie für Haus und Garten, sowie zum Gassi gehen mit unserem Hund. Wenn sie mal dreckig werden sind sie durch ihre Kunststoffoberfläche leicht zu reinigen. Unsere haben auch nicht besonders stark gerochen und sind ""made in italy"".Man sollte auch nicht den Fehler machen Crocs mit anderen Billigclogs zu vergleichen. Sie sind auf jeden Fall ihren Preis wert.Wir würden sie jederzeit wieder kaufen.

  Io non sono amante delle ciabatte e affini in casa,ma questo sono decisamente e paurosamente comode!! Le adoro. Ho preso un 43-44 visto che io generalmente di scarpa porto un 43,ma sono leggermente comode,forse sarebbe stato meglio prendere le 42-43,ma non scappano comunque dal piede e rimangono ben salde al loro posto. Comunque sul sito delle Crocs o cercando su internet,si trova la scheda per misurarsi il piede e scegliere la misura ideale,senza incorrere in piccoli errori.Decisamente Consigliate!!!

  nach über 6 Jahren täglicher Benutzung als Hausschuh, auf der Straße, im Garten, am Strand, im Wasser, im Urlaub...... ist die Sohle dann doch reichlich dünn geworden.Auf der Suche nach Nachfolger konnte ich dank Einblendung von Amazon ""dieses Modell haben Sie schon einmal am xxx 2012 gekauft"" (wusste ich nicht mehr) sofort neu bestellen. Problematisch war nämlich die (kaum noch lesbare) Größenangabe 7 - 9, die ich heute nirgendwo finden konnte.Nachtrag: ich sehe gerade, daß 7 - 9 der Größe 39/40 entspricht. Normalerweise habe ich Größe 41. Es macht also Sinn, etwas knapper zu kaufen, da sich diese Crocs im Laufe der Zeit weiten

  Zunächst fühlten sich die Schuhe an meinen Füßen etwas zu groß an, aber nachdem ich sie einige Stunden getragen hatte, haben sich meine Füße daran gewöhnt - oder umgekehrt. Ich trage sie täglich viele Stunden als Hausschuhe und möchte sie inzwischen nicht mehr missen. Nachdem ich die Schuhe immer bei anderen gesehen hatte und mich das Design alles andere als ansprach, war ich doch recht skeptisch - erst recht, nachdem ich in einigen Rezensionen vom angeblichen chemischen Geruch dieser Schuhe gelesen hatte. Mein Exemplar roch von Anfang an völlig neutral. Das Beste ist, dass sie auch noch nach mittlerweile wochenlangem Tragen noch völlig neutral riechen. Das Design überzeugt mich zwar immer noch nicht, aber als Hausschuhe finde ich sie perfekt.

  und habe lange Zeit nichts von den Plastikschuhen gehalten. Bis meine Frau sich dann ein Paar zugelegt hat. Ich hab sie dann einfach mal ausprobiert und mir daraufhin gleich selber ein Paar bestellt. Benutze sie als Hausschuhe.Ich bin nun echt begeistert, man geht sehr gut auf den Schuhen, auch wenn man sie den ganzen Tag trägt. Und trotzdem schwitzt man nicht. Komischerweise bekommt man aber auch ohne Strümpfe keine kalten Füße, obwohl doch sehr viele Öffnungen / Löcher in den Schuhen sind. Das Fußbett ist besser als in den meisten Hausschuhen, die ich kenne. Habe in den alten immer Rückenschmerzen bekommen, wenn ich längere Zeit mit ihnen gelaufen bin, mit den Crocs habe ich keine Probleme mehr.Man kann sie mit Fersenriemen tragen, kann diesen aber auch einfach nach vorne klappen und hat dann einen offenen Fersenbereich. Wir haben in der gesamten Wohnung Parkett und haben bis heute noch nicht einen einzigen Abriebstreifen feststellen müssen.Also mich haben sie überzeugt.

  Ich bin total zufrieden mit meinen total bequemen Crocs. Die Lieferung war wieder superschnell und für alle, die sich desöfteren beschweren, dass die Crocs stinken würden: diese nicht! Auch die Qualität ist m.E. einwandfrei.Aber einen Tipp hätte ich noch: ich trage normalerweise Gr. 39 und im Crocs-Shop wurde mir gesagt, dass ich Gr. 9 (also 39/40) hätte. Die passen dann zwar auch (obwohl es nicht gerade einen schlanken Fuß macht...), aber die Halteriemchen rutschen dann bzw. passen nicht. In Gr. 8 sind sie dann aber perfekt (38/39). Somit ärgere ich mich jetzt nur, dass ich damals auf die Verkäuferin gehört habe. Die Nächsten (und die werden bald ausgesucht!) sind also eine Nr. kleiner als normal.

Und sie sind so praktisch: egal, ob am Strand oder im Garten, wenn sie dreckig geworden sind, einfach unter Wasser halten und gut ist.Ich muss dazu sagen, dass ich vor zwei Jahren noch an einer Plyneuropathie und sehr schmerzenden Füßen litt. In keinem Paar Schuhe konnte ich länger als eine halbe Stunde am Stück laufen, ausser in den Cocs.

  Ich musste mir neue Crocs bestellen, weil ich meine Alten versehentlich starker Hitze ausgesetzt hatte, und dadurch sind sie 2 Nummern geschrumpft. Da ich jedoch sehr zufrieden war, habe ich mir wieder Crocs gekauft, diese und auch noch die mit dem Fellinlet für den Winter. Die Schuhe sind zwar extrem globig und sehen nicht sonderlich sexy aus, an das Damenmodell habe ich mich jedoch nicht rangetraut, weil ich keinen Erfahrungswert hinsichtlich Größe und Passform hatte.Die Schuhe sind super bequem, man kann damit den ganzen Tag rumlaufen (egal ob mit oder ohne Socken) und läuft wie auf Wolken, weil das Material so schön weich und flexibel ist. Trotzdem sind sie stabil und halten einiges aus. Sowohl für Privat als auch für die Arbeit empfehlenswert.

  Halten erstaunlich lange, nach einigen Jahren erst laufen sie sich durch.Sind robust, machen viel mit, auch im Outdooreinsatz prima, selbst durch niedrige Flüsse kann man damit waten.Die mit den Löchern vorne sammeln Schnecken ein im hohen Gras - daher für Outdoor besser die geschlossenen verwenden.Sehr gefährlich aber auf nassen Fliesenböden - hier zieht es einem förmlich die Füsse weg. Sturzgefahr!Auf die Grössenangaben ist kein Verlass, da hilft nur anprobieren.Als Hausschuhe verwendet, kann man sich gut die Füße cremen, ohne den Boden einzusauen oder die Creme ungewollt in die Socken zu schmieren. ;o)Man liebt sie oder man hasst sie - wir lieben sie.

  Ich habe meinem Freund ein Paar Crocs ""Cayman's"" geschenkt. Er hatte sich die ganze Zeit gesträubt diese Schuhe zu kaufen, weil er sie so hässlich fand. Nachdem ich mir aus gesundheitlichen Gründen einen gut gedämpften Hausschuh kaufen musste und das erste Paar Crocs ins Haus kam, war ich schnell überzeugt. Mein Freund hat sich dann nach und nach anstecken lassen. Inzwischen ist er selbst zum Fan geworden und trägt die Schuhe jeden Tag.Ich würde die Schuhe (aus ästhetischen Gründen) zwar nicht als typischen Straßenschuh tragen; aber auf dem Weg zum Sport, am Strand, in der Sauna oder eben als Hausschuh...etc. leisten sie gute Dienste. Sie sind sehr bequem, äußerst robust und scheinen auch sehr langlebig zu sein. Außerdem habe ich auch ohne Socken warme Füße.... und das will was heißen!Am Anfang riechen die Crocs etwas komisch, das geht aber nach 2-3 Tagen komplett weg. Genau so ist es mit dem Empfinden am Fuß. Ich dachte am Anfang, dass die Schuhe viel zu groß sind und ich schwitzige Füße in den Dingern habe. Aber die Crocs haben einen sehr weiten Schnitt und hinter der Ferse ist immer noch einen Daumen breit Platz wenn Sie richtig sitzen. Und nachdem die Füße sich an die Massagenoppen im Schuh gewöhnt haben, fühlt sich der Fuß auch nicht mehr schwitzig an!Fazit:Ich kann Crocs - und hier speziell die klassischen ""Cayman's"" - uneingeschränkt empfehlen. (Achtung: Wer sich ein anderes Modell von Crocs kaufen will, sollte vorher die Größen ausprobieren. Habe festgestellt, dass sich diese manchmal etwas unterscheiden!)

El material es un plastico ligero que advierten por ahí que no se debe exponer a altas temperaturas o se encogerá. Son muy comodas, sobre todo para estar de pie, evitan bien que el pie se canse. No son especialmente bonitas pero bueno al menos en rojo por lo menos son graciosas. Se les puede poner como unos ""pins"" que llaman para darles un toque aún más gracioso.

  Schuhe aus Plastik sind eigentlich gar nicht mein Geschmack. Ich habe sie mir auf Anraten eines Orthopäden gekauft, weil ich schon 6 Monate mit Fersensporn zu kämpfen hatte. Die Schuhe haben sicherlich mit dazu beigetragen, daß der Fersensporn rasch besser wurde. Einen Punkt Abzug, weil meine Füße in ihnen bei wärmeren Temperaturen trotz der ""Belüftungslöcher"" schwitzen.

  Leider habe ich die Crocs versehentlich in der Sonne stehen lassen und sie sind um 2 Nummern geschrumpft. Mir war dieses Problem bewusst. Ich finde es trotzdem schade, da man eigentlich die Schuhe nur im Haus tragen kann bzw. diese immer in den Schatten stellen muss sobald man sie auszieht. Schnell geht das mal vergessen. Die recht neuen Schuhe sind somit untragbar.

  Crocs sind ja inzwischen Klassiker geworden und das ist auch nicht mein erstes Paar. Auch wenn die Schuhe inzwischen einen ähnlichen Imageverfall erlebt haben, wie in den 80ern BOSS oder Kenwood. Die Schuhe bleiben prima und wenn man sie dort trägt, wo sie hingehören, nämlich zuhause, dann erspart man den anderen auch den mitunter erschreckenden Ausblick auf besockte oder freiliegende Fußnägel.

  Jetzt habe ich mir nach neun Jahren doch wieder ein neues Paar gekauft. Natürlich werden auch bei diesem irgendwann die Riemen abreißen und alles immer dünner werden, aber Schuhe, die man viel trägt, gehen eben irgendwann kaputt, auch wenn sie aus Plastikgummi oder irgendsoetwas sind. Ich trage sie ja als Hausschuhe, zum Radfahren, zum Baden in der Isar, um im Urlaub an den Strand zu laufen, also oft, sehr oft. Wenn es kühl ist, wärmen sie ein bisschen - zu hause im Winter trage ich sie mit Socken. Wenn es heiß ist, sind sie luftig - man kann rausschlupfen und die Füße draufstellen. Und natürlich trage ich sie auch jetzt.

Ich habe es nicht bereut!Die Schuhe sind aus Syntethik, aber durch die Löcher bekommt der Fuß genug Luft zum atmen = kein Schwitzen. Der Schuh ist wunderbar weich und gibt bei jedem Schritt sanft nach = sehr guter Laufkomfort. Das Rot ist richtig schön knallig, besser als auf dem Bild, das eher nach pink aussieht. Ich habe meine normale Schuhgröße bestellt und der Schuh passt perfekt.Ich trage sie als Pantolette. Man kann das Riemchen aber auch nach hinten tragen für mehr Halt.

  Items was fine. However, being it was a Xmas gift, the fact it did not come in an official Crocs box was very disappointing. There was no indication to expect this sacrifice in the product description. It's only luck the shoes weren't damaged while traveling in the ""bag"" they were shipped in.

  Sono molto soddisfatta dell'acquisto. Le ho comprate per me e per mio marito con il principale scopo di utilizzarle quando siamo nel nostro giardino per non dover passare ogni volta da pantofola a scarpa e sono perfette per lo scopo. Io non le userei per andarci in giro e non saprei dire se sarebbero sufficientemente comode per camminare sulla strada, ma non lo escludo. Per la taglia, io porto 37, quindi ho preso 36/37 e mi vanno giuste (l'unghia tocca appena la punta) e non sono troppo larghe. Idem per mio marito per il quale ho preso 39/40. Il colore è molto bello, sobrio ed ""elegante"". Prezzo ottimo (ho usufruito anche di una promozione del 20%) e consegna rapida.

  Die Crocs sind sehr angenehm zu tragen und haben ein leichtes Muster auf der Innenseite des Schuhs, was die Fußsohle massiert, wenn man geht. Das einzige, was zu bemängeln ist, ist die Größenangabe.Normaler weiße trage ich z.B. bei Adidas Schuhen eine 42 2/3 also eine 8 1/2. Ich habe mir bei den Crocs allerdings eine 8 (41-42) bestellen müssen, da sie in 9 (42-43) viel zu groß waren.Ansonsten bin ich jetzt mit der richtigen Größe vollstens zufrieden!

  erst hatte ich diese Crocs in weiß für meine Arbeit (Arztpraxis) bestellt, und durch den wundervollen Tragekomfort, den diese Schuhe bieten, habe ich mich entschlossen, sie nun auch in rosa als Hausschuh zu tragen. Im Sommer sind sie schön luftig, man braucht keine Socken und der Fuß schwitzt nicht in ihnen, die Schuhe geben aber dennoch einen guten Halt und sie sind auch ohne Riemchen (dieses kann man einfach nach vorne klappen), ein sicheres Schuhwerk, in dem man auch mal schneller gehen kann, ohne zu stolpern oder den Halt zu verlieren. In der kälteren Jahreszeit lassen sich Kuschelsocken sehr angenehm in dem Schuh tragen, man hat nicht das Gefühl, einen ""Plastikschuh"" zu tragen, sondern geht wie auf Wolken! Klare Kaufempfehlung!

  Ich trage diese Crocs zu Hause und freue mich jedes mal, wenn ich sie anziehe. Mit, oder ohne Socken, meine Füße und meine Beine fühlen sich wohl. Ist es heiß, kühlen die Clogs, ist es kühl wärmen sie die Füße. Meine Ödeme haben sich zurückgebildet und die Beine profitieren von einer besseren Statik und guter Massage der Fußsohlen. Das Belüftungssystem der Classics ist super, das Material der Crocs ist angenehmer, als jedes andere und man rutscht nicht aus den ""Pantoffeln"".Die Clogs sind äußerst bequem und angenehm. Deshalb habe ich meiner Frau auch welche gekauft und sie trägt sie genau so gerne, wie ich. Schade nur, dass es ihre Größe 38/39 nur in wenigen Farben gibt. Sie hätte gerne eine hellere Farbe, als Navy - blau, gewählt.Trotzdem, wir sind sehr zufrieden und empfehlen die Crocs Classic ohne Einschränkung mit fünf Sternen.

  Premesso che è il primo paio di Crocs che prendo sono rimasto favorevolmente colpito dalla loro comodità. Oltre che essere comode e spaziose anche per chi, come me, ha il piede con un collo abbondante, ho scoperto che, a differenza delle altre ciabatte e zoccoli, non si corre il rischio di perderli durante il cammino. Sembra in tutto e per tutto di indossare un paio di scarpe, rimangono attaccate al piede! Veramente ottimi.

  Dieser Schuh ist zwar nicht so weich wie ein Chung Shi Dux, jedoch bevorzugen wir mittlerweile Crocs. Unsere sind in Italien hergestellt und riechen nach dem auspacken nicht nach Chemie. Die Passform ist super. Weit genug um im Winter auch die dicken Wollsocken anzuziehen zu können, aber nicht zu weit um herauszurutschen. Es gab kein Problem mit der Größe. Eine 39/40 ist auch eine deutsche 39/40. Auch nach mehrmaligem Tragen keine ""Stinkefüße"". Super - nach langem probieren endlich passende ""Plastikschuhe"".

  La misura è perfetta, avendone acquistato un paio per prova, nè ho subito acquistati altri. Sono leggerissimi e comodi, li ho presi per la piscina, ma i miei figli li usano anche a casa. Li ho consigliati ad una mia collega che ha un 36 e li ha presi per lavorare in ospedale, mi ha detto che ai piedi non li sente. Costano pochissimo, vale la pena provarli.

Die über die crogs meckern das die in der Sonne zwei Nummern kleiner werden nach dem waschen sind selber schuld. Direkt in der Sonne stellt man keinen Schuh . Die sollen selber trocknen im Schatten.egel ob es crogs oder Sportschuhe. Manchmal passiert in der Sonne nichts das heißt nicht das es korrekt ist. Also kaufen und die crogs genießen.

,Leiyla,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Ich hatte jahrelang eine billige Variante aus dem örtlichen Discounter. Als ich dann an einer neuen Arbeitstelle angefangen habe , habe ich mir auf die Empfehlung einer Kollegin hin ein paar Crocs gekauft.Die ersten paar Male taten mir die Füße nach langem stehen (5+ Std) höllisch weh aber mit der Zeit hat sich das dann auch gelegt.Die Schuhe sind sehr luftig , sodass falls man einmal zu heiß bekommen sollte man einfach die Beine entwas ausschütteln muss um einen angenehmen Luftzug an den Füßen zu spüren.Auch ich hatte am meisten Bedenken , dass ich in diesen Schuhen übermäßig schwitzen würde. Dazu muss ich sagen dass man zwar schwitzt (nicht übermäßig sondern ganz normal wie in jedem Schuh) aber dadurch dass man mal schnell den Schuh ausziehen kann um zu lüften vergeht das schnell.Was in meinem Beruf noch wichtig war, ist die Rutschfestigkeit und die kann überzeugen. Ich arbeite an der Rezeption eines Schwimmbades und muss manchmal auch in den Nassbereich und bisher hatte ich immer sicheren Stand.Wer rutschfeste , gemütliche , luftige und eher praktische als stylische Haus- oder Arbeitsschuhe sucht dem kann ich diese Crocs nur empfehlen.

  Mes anciennes crocs ont 3 ans, largement très usées, utilisées en chaussures d'intérieures, elles étaient encore très confortables, mais d'apparence délabrée.J'ai commandé cette paire de crocs noires, en provenance d'Italie comme cela est indiqué sous les crocs que j'ai reçu. Pourtant la qualité de chaussage n'est pas la même : le matériaux est plus rigide. Au lieu de délasser mes pieds, ces crocs m'échauffent le pied et me fatiguent. Ce n'est plus un réel bonheur de les enfiler en rentrant chez soi.J'ai patienté quelques semaines avant d'écrire ce commentaire, pensant que cela allait s'estomper avec le temps mais non... alors, contrefaçon ou baisse de qualité chez Crocs ? Bonne question... mais j'ai acheté là ma dernière paire de Crocs.

  Gli zoccoli sono arrivati in confezione integra e nei tempi indicati come sempre accade con Amazon. Il problema è che, a differenza delle precedenti che ho acquistato per la moglie, questa sono made in Cina (e non in Italy come le altre...) e ho dovuto lasciarle in terrazza per 7 giorni e in acqua e detersivo per altrettanti a causa dell'odore da petrolio che emanavano. Impossibili da indossare in casa.

Sieht in natura aus wie eine Mischung aus blau, petrol und grün. Sie haben einen leichten Eigengeruch, der aber nicht stört, man riecht es nur, wenn man die Nase direkt dran hält, dieser verschwindet auch schon etwas nach ein paar Tagen.

Es waren mein ersten Crocs und zunächst war ich mir unsicher, ob das wirklich etwas für mich ist.Ich habe sie zunächst im Krankenhaus als Arbeitsschuh verwendet; inzwischen sind sie ""in Rente"" und werden als Hausschuhe getragen. Ich muss zugeben, dass ich kein Fan von Schuhen in der Wohnung bin, doch bei diesen Crocs ist ein optimales Tragegefühl geboten.

  Sehr gut verarbeiteter und pass genauer Schlappen. Hab den nicht nur als Hausschuh sondern auf für die Gartenarbeit wie Rasenmähen. Einen Makel hat er aber dann doch. Durch das Kunstsoffmaterial ist er sehr anfällig für direkte Sonneneinstrahlung. Meine Gartenschuhe die nach getaner Arbeit vor der Tür bleiben sind nach 1 Sommer um 1 Schuhgröße geschrumpft.

  Ich bin begeistert. Dieses Modell kostet normal 25 bis 30 Euro und ich konnte die Schuhe in rot für knapp 11 Euro ergattern. Super bequem. Weit genug auch für superbreite Füße. Ich habe bei Schuhen mit dünnen Sohlen oft Schmerzen in der Ferse. Bei Crocs tut nichts weh. Die dicke Sohle gibt leicht nach und ist wie ein Kissen für die Ferse. Herrlich.

  Die Crocs sind wirklich großartig. Bei diesem Wetter nütze ich jede Gelegenheit, mit meinem Hund im nahen Bach zu planschen - und dabei sind die Crocs unverzichtbare Begleiter. Und für den ans Bad anschließenden Spaziergang mit dem Hund sind die Crocs auch bestens geeignet. Der Kauf war eine sehr gute Entscheidung!

  Prinzipiell sind die Schuhe echt klasse. Sie sind sehr bequem und ich kann sie im Sommer im Büro genauso anziehen wie im Garten.Allerdings stehen die Schuhe dadurch auch mal draußen. Nach dem ersten Sommer waren sie dann zwei Nummern kleiner - unfassbar wie sehr sie eingegangen sind. Mir ist klar, dass man die Schuhe nicht einem ständigen Sonnenlicht und Wärme aussetzten sollte, aber auf der anderen Seite sollten doch gerade die Marken-Crocs zumindest einen Sommer aushalten. Insofern keine klare Kaufempfehlung.

  私自身は過去使用したことがないのですが、高齢親族の入院時の履物として「スニーカーより着脱がしやすく、スリッパのように転びやすくない」ものを用意してほしいと言われ、クロックスしか思いつきませんでした。医師もそれで問題ないと判断したので、目立つ色で安価なものを選び購入。リハビリにも全く支障無かったうえ、看護師や理学療法士などから口々にお洒落だと褒められたらしく、使用した本人は非常に満足だったようです。退院後も普段履きとして使用したいとのこと、さらに退院後の家の中のスリッパもクロックスにしました。子どもや若者用のイメージがありますが、サイズさえ合えば他の高齢者の方にもお薦めできるのではないでしょうか。少なくとも病院や施設内のようにバリアフリーな場所にはかなり向くようです。まあ私は専門家でないので、念のため医師やリハビリ担当者の意見を聞いてみていただきたいですが...私もサイズの大雑把なスリッパは好きではないので、自身のものもクロックスにしていいかなと今では思っています。ただ、価格変動が大きいようなので、急ぎではない自分用は様子を見てからと考えていますが。

  Die Grössenangaben von Crocs finde ich persönlich generell äusserst gewöhnungsbedürftig....Wir besitzen bereits die diversesten Crocs und mögen sie sehr.Wir wissen, dass sie je nach Modell ""großzügig"" ausfallen, aber trotz des Abzuges einer Schuhgröße waren diese Crocs dennoch viel zu groß (bestellt in 42/43 für Gr. 44) und mussten daher leider zurück geschickt werden. SCHADE!

  Ich war immer ein wenig skeptisch Crocs gegenüber.Ich habe mir nun doch welche zugelegt, da ich angefangen habe im Krankenhaus zu arbeiten. Dort trage ich sie nun auch jeden Tag und finde die Crocs wirklich super.Die Farbe sieht toll aus (pink) und sie sind wirklich bequem. Vor den Crocs, habe ich immer Sportschuhe zum Arbeiten getragen, dann hatte ich im Feierabend meist schmerzende Füße. Das hat sich mit den Crocs nun geändert :)Am Anfang haben mich diese Noppel an der Sohle etwas gestört, aber man gewöhnt sich super schnell dran und jetzt bemerke ich sie gar nich mehr.

  Ne avevo già un paio di parecchi anni prima, ma non sono cambiate quasi per niente, sempre comodissime versatili e facili da pulire e lavare. Consigliatissime come cibatte per stare in casa.

,Cliente Amazon,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  È il quarto paio di Crocs che acquisto ma queste “Made in Mexico” calzano più lungo e largo di tutte le altre, le ho restituite sperando di ritrovarle Made in Italy (le più comode e morbide in assoluto).

  Crocs sind eben Crocs und nicht einfach nur irgendwelche Kunststoff-Clogs. Die jetzt von Amazon gelieferten Crocs unterscheiden sich nicht von den vor einigen Jahren gekauften, außer dass Letztere mittlerweile etwas abgelaufen sind. So hatte ich es erwartet, und so ist es gut für mich und meine Füße.

  Die original Crocs tragen sich deutlich angenehmer als anderen, ähnliche Schuhe. Das Material passt sich dem Fuß gut an und bleibt dauerhaft weich. Die Haltbarkeit ist ebenfalls sehr gut, auch nach langjährigen Gebrauch bleiben die Schuhe in Form und auch die Gelenke des Fersenriemens bleiben stabil.Das Original ist zwar teurer als die zahlreichen Kopien, aber ich würde es immer bevorzugen.

  Crocs passen sehr gut u geliefert wurden sie rechtzeitig. Leider lässt die Qualität des Lieferanten sehr zu wünschen übrig...

  Bought these to use in back yard for gardening/mowing the lawn. Comfy, and they stay on well. Don’t forsee any issues.
