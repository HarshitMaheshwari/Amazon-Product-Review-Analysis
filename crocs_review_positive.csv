How Crocs Changed My Life
",Heidi Bumanlag,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I will admit, I once was a hater. I lived a hateful negative life where I truly despised this footwear. But recently I've made many drastic life changes and these shoes have helped me see the light. They have helped me to see the beauty of the world and give me the confidence to face whatever obstacles life may throw my way. I can now walk outside with confidence. These shoes, these marvelous shoes, help me to live my life to the fullest not only in style but with such comfort no amount of words can begin to describe. I will now continue to live my life with an open mind to such fashion statements. No more will I live with my head hung low, but now I wear my crocs with pride. Sports mode empowers me while relaxed mode truly is the epitome of serenity. Crocs have also been the glue that has bonded me and one my best friends. Crocs truly change your life and bring people together. I will forever be indebted to this spectacular shoe.

Freesail vs Classic
",Jeanne,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I own 2 pair of Crocs women's Freesail and figured I'd try a pair of the classics.  The Freesail are much trimmer & narrower in width than the  women's Classics.  I love both.  The Classics are quite a bit boxier and wider in width  than the Freesail and the Classics seem to have a bit more  cushioning on the bottom.  Both work well for my problem feet which are usually sporting the Alegria brand shoes/sandals  for work.  However, on weekends and downtime, I prefer Crocs.  I have hammer toes  and deteriorating foot joints and have lost most of natural cushioning on the bottom of my feet making it feel like I'm walking on marbles. I typically wear a women's 8/12 or a European size  39.  In Crocs, I always  go a size 9 for the length.  I love both the Freesail and Classics and would urge anyone with ""touchy feet"" to give these a try.

Cutest Comfy Ugly Shoe You Can Buy
",FLRL,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I bought this classic fit (wide) shoe in size 6 men to get a size 8 women's.  It fits perfectly.  Most comfortable shoe or clog ever.  They are also ugly but they are so ugly that they are cute. To be clear, I bought these to wear with fluffy socks so I have the room I need (my feet are not wide) when wearing the fluffy socks. The strap can be in the back or in the front.  I like having it across my heel when wearing socks.  Feet don't sweat thanks to all of the vents.  You can also put cute little Jibbitz on them that people will notice and take their attention away from the ugly shoes.  You can wear these things all day, 10-12 hours and your feet and legs will hold out.  I got the original classic style because so many people online complained about the soles coming apart on the newer style.  So buyer beware, if you try them you will love them.

and we like how easy it is to get them on
",Tyler,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I never, ever thought I'd wear Crocs, but here I am.Our 1.5 year old daughter loves her Crocs, and we like how easy it is to get them on, how we don't have to fuss over socks, etc. They're great summer shoes for kids. After a while I started thinking about getting myself a pair just as yard work/grilling/fishing/etc. shoes for the same reason. Which is what they started as, but during one Home Depot trip I realized I never took them off and was wearing them out. Fair game, I guess I'm living the Croc life now.Regarding sizing, I saw some strange advice all over. And perhaps it's different between colors, so for clarity's sake I got the Khaki color. Anyway, I saw some people talking about sizing down, but I really don't think that's the right way to go. Crocs do feel loose on your feet, but just wear them around a bit and you'll realize that they're just fine and very secure. The bottom ""floats"" a little bit so you don't develop blisters, but the strap holds them to your feet pretty well. If this were a normal shoe, then I'd size down. But it's not, and it doesn't wear/stretch/weigh the same, so I recommend getting your true size. I'm a 12D, sometimes 11.5 or 12.5, and once in a blue moon a 13. Size 12 works fine for me here.

",Grace Jane,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are my first crocs.  I have avoided crocs because they are big clown shoes in appearance and I didn't want look like a ...you know.  I finally bought a pair because I am now swimming regularly and needed shoes that could get wet at the pool.  I hate flip flops, which abrade the tender area between big toe and second toe.  Well, I bought the crocs and they are awesome!  Very comfortable.  I have arthritis in my feet and the crocs are surprisingly supportive.  I wear them for long drives.  They are great at the dog park or in the back yard where I am likely to step in something that is very difficult to clean off sneakers but comes off easily with a hose or a wipe from my clogs.  Best of all, I look cool in them, and I know this because the younger generation is impressed.  Not the 20 somethings, who tend to roll their eyes, or my contemporaries who look askance and ask if I have been gardening but the stylesetters of tomorrow.  I wore them to the beach and a toddler and a four year old both patted my shoes. Now I want crocs in every color of the rainbow.

Never thought I'd buy but very happy now
",Chris Luiszer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Never thought I'd buy a pair of crocs. I've been making fun of them for the past decade but when we moved into a new place with hard floors, I needed something to wear around the house. I stand/walk a lot at work and wanted something that was very comfortable.Got these bad boys and couldn't be happier. After a long day in dress shoes I look forward to wearing these when I get home. Great for working around the house and going up and down the stairs on hard flooring. I flip the strap up and go for the clog configuration. The look better that way and stay on fine without the strap behind your heel. Also nice that they are pretty grippy. I wear them cooking in the kitchen and don't have any issues when I spill stuff on the floor.I would definitely recommend these to anyone. They don't look the coolest but I'm a dad now so I'm fine with that. They are a much more comfortable upgrade from flip flop or slipper for wearing around the house. My only regret is not getting a cool color. If you're gonna get crocs you might as well go big!

Comfy but there are size inconsistencies
",WampThing,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I ordered 2 pairs of these crocs classics, cerulean and pepper. Pepper is a true red (I was worried it might look pink) and the cerulean is very blue, not purple at all. I usually wear men's size 8.5 shoes and an m8/w10 fit when tried on in a store. However I read lots of reviews that said the sizes were very inconsistent. I need these soon so don't have time to mess with exchanges so I ordered m8/w10 and m9/w11. They were exactly the same size. Width, length, everything was the same, it was weird. I think they fit more like a m9/w11 but that's fine. I wanted/expected these to be pretty loose like my old ones from over a decade ago. These are pretty comfy like I remember and hopefully they last like my old ones did. I didn't find them shiny, uncomfortably small/narrow or the nubs inside to be too painful, which were all common complaints. Overall I say try them on in store first especially if you're in between sizes. I have high hopes for these. (These are the made in mexico ones by the way)

Yay, crocs!
",captainbars,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Because of wide feet, I've been afraid of ordering these popular shoes.  Over the years I've had to return or give away shoes I carefully chose, cos only the front of my feet are wide (like a duck). Have to have some sort of strap, or tie on.  My siblings would urge me to try them, so I took the plunge. The 1st pair had to be returned because of a simply mistake at the factory; the wrong size was put in the box.  The replacement arrived yesterday, and I could turn cartwheels, if I could. So comfortable, roomy, and no breaking in period. With regular leather shoes, the little toe on my right foot is still squeezed; with the Crocs, no problem!  And it keeps my feet cool! These are officially my fav shoes. Plan to buy more in diff colors.

My new FAVORITE SHOES 💯😊
",B & L,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I am so GRATEFUL my sis got her Croc’s for work and then I thought to myself those are super comfy looking. Well yes they are comfy and easy to clean. I’m basically wearing them anytime I have to run outside to do gardening or pick up dog poop 💩, I’ve also worn them out running errands as well. I love the bright blue color I got. I had to return the first pair I ordered since they were too large. So I went a size down and they fit perfectly! I couldn’t be happier with this purchase! Oh and I’ve stepped in a massive pile of GSD 💩 and it washes right off these adorable shoes. Perfect function so easy to clean. I’m literally hooked for life and I don’t know how I never bought 🐊 Croc’s before?!?!My order came in the time frame they said it would. It took about a week, with Prime. Worth the wait. I love the fact that they look good with everything I wear. I don’t dress up much so I wouldn’t recommend wearing them with an evening gown 😂 but they are breathable and my feet don’t stink in these either. They were in new packaging too. I will get lots of use out of these for sure. They are super comfortable and actually feel great on my feet. All and all my new favorite house shoes 💯!!! I definitely recommend this purchase to anyone out there who hasn’t tried these out before! They are amazing! Stay safe out there!

  My husband wore crocs on our first date and I honestly almost ended it then, but I decided what the heck. Who cares what he wears on his feet?? Then he revealed that he usually wears his crocs with SOCKS. It’s freaking hideous and I have made fun of him for YEARS. But recently, I needed a pair of shoes to toss on to take the dog on quick walks or just run to the mailbox and he surprised me with a pair of these bad boys (in mint, my favorite color). I swore I wouldn’t wear them.. and yet, Here I am! Wearing them every stinkin day now!! These shoes are not stylish. They make your feet look like gigantic doll feet. But they are THE most comfortable and convenient shoes I’ve ever worn. They are easy to clean, breathable and great for days at the beach or river. If my husband sees this, I admit I was wrong. I still won’t say that out loud, but here ya go.

The insole was a little uncomfortable the first few days of wearing them, they poke and feel wired and itch your feet s bit after you take them off but after wearing them a few days , I don’t even wanna take them off! Lol➡️ Sizing!!! ⬅️I was skeptical about ordering them online because I don’t know my size in there size but after much research and reviews I figured out that crocks are more comfortable and suppose to fit big!I wear a Size 9.5 (men) and have a pretty wide foot and everywhere said to size one up so I got size 10 (men) and they fit perfectly and comfortably!Over all I would recommend a pair for everyone ! Went outside did some grading stuff rinsed them right off looked good as new!! Can’t wait to Customize them! 10/10 recommend!

Crocs are my life
",martina machado,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Where do I begin. If you do not own a pair of crocs by now, you need to buy yourself a pair right now. I used to buy “crocs” from the 99 cents store because I was on a budget, and by budget I mean absolutely broke. It wasn’t until I got my first job two years ago where I bought my first real pair and mannnn when I tell you that these are the most comfortable shoes ever, these are the most comfortable shoes ever. I can’t believe I was walking around in the knock off ones with no support, no wonder my back hurt so much. Well here I am two years later and I own 18 pairs of crocs. Everybody used to make fun of me but now I have people asking me for croc recommendations. If you are worried about looking dumb because these aren’t the cutest foot wear out there, these shoes are made to help you come as you are. If you are confident, it shines through. I almost have every color in the classic clogs and I am now going to invest in some bayaband, lite ride and bistro clogs. Crocs are an everyday, every moment type of thing for me and I am so glad that I am able to truly express myself through my beautiful crocs.I WILL SAY AS A SIDENOTE, those who experience discomfort, it may be because you have a flat foot as those with flat feet are better of wearing shoes like vans, converse, etc. (shoes that have no arch support)

Works great on my feet!
",rabbit,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  My chiropractor recommended wearing crocs since I started having plantar fasciitis problems. I usually wear woman's size 8 shoes, and got these in size 8. They seem a little big but it's actually more comfortable to wear that way, so I think these fit me perfectly. I like to life up the back holder part and wear them around like sandals. It's also nice when it's cold cause I can just slip them on with my socks on. As for dealing with my plantar fasciitis, it ended up working for me! I wore these every day, and at first I didn't notice that much of a difference and my feet ached in the morning for a while too, but around a year into wearing these, I have completely recovered from plantar fasciitis!! It's like I never even had plantar fasciitis before! I think it took a while for my feet to heal since it's something we use every day. Now I am able to wear normal flat sandals too and my feet are fine in the mornings. I still wear crocs and their brand sandals for my main footwear though, cause I think it helps to prevent plantar fasciitis from happening.

Husband Hates the Look, LOVES the feel
",Nancy A. Ropecka,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  My husband has Plantar fasciitis (as I also have) and he has tried different inserts, balls to rub his feet on, exercises, etc.I have been wearing Crocs for over a year and they have alleviated my pain significantly, but he didn't like the way they looked.So, I decided to buy him a pair for Christmas, told him to just wear them around the house.

BABYYYYY My feet are in Heaven
",Ms. Tee,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  So full disclosure in this review so please don't judge. There aren't any Crocs stores in the area I live in but I heard they were really comfortable and good support for people who are on their feet all day. I have issues with my arches and typically wear arch supports in my shoes so that I can both walk better and so my feet don't hurt. When I don't wear my arch supports, my feet hurt and the pain radiates up to my knees and higher. I love to wear flip flops but if you are like me, your doctor told you heck no that's horrible for your feet.So, I purchased a bunch of ""garden"" shoes or fake crocs. Don't get me wrong these are amazing and I wear them all the time I just had no idea that they weren't real crocs. Let me try to explain.I saw the yellow colored crocs in DSW about 3 weeks ago and fell in love, but of course they didn't have any more even online in my size in yellow. I come to trusty old AMAZON and they are selling for more than $40. No thank you I will wait. I check out the CROCS site and with shipping its more than that. So I wait. I wait and wait until they drop down to $31 and change and I get em. Now you guys don't know me but I am just excited to add another color to my collection so I thought.I sprayed them down with Lysol after I open the zip lock bag they were in and sat them on my back porch you know for safety and all that good stuff. So I take the trash out and remember that they are out there so I bring em in and wash em off again because now they have outside germs even though no one has been on or near my back porch. I dry them off and put them on my feet.HALLELUJAH!!!!I thought I had ascended to heaven! You don't know the struggles I have with these here size 8's. The support I felt, the cushion I felt, the prinkly things in the shoe that massage my feet while feeling slightly weird when my toes touch them when I am sitting, it all was surreal. I woke up my brother. I went outside and screamed YES YES YES like I was a WWE wrestler. I immediately came back to amazon to look and see what color shoe I didn't have to order more.Needless to say, I look at price too and I can't afford any of these colors at this time but I LOVE MY YELLOW CROCS. I prefer crocs over sneakers or tennis but I wear tennis to protect my foot in case I feel like jogging or running.Buy you these shoes. Don't have any yet? Ain't nothing like the real thing is all I have to say.TRUST ME ON THIS ONE!Signed,A Satisfied customer

",Simone Alicia,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Ordered a W8. This is my first pair of Crocs & I’m not sure whyyyyyy I waited this long to get a pair. Now I see why ppl use it. Very comfortable. I’m flat footed. I was able to wear it barefoot & also w| thin socks (tester around the house). The strap part to keep your feet in, it’s actually shorter than the actual length of the shoe (it’s not lined up with the heel part . Around a quarter of an inch or so from the heel) so when it goes around the back of your foot, it actually pushes your feel more inside the shoe. This isn’t a big deal for me as I’m actually a 7.5 women’s. I always love ordering any shoe item a half size bigger to have the extra room for thicker socks if needed. My Crocs were made in Mexico. I’ve seen some complaints about sizing issues when it’s made in different countries. Anyways, I would recommend a pair to anyone.

Great versatile play shoes
",Kate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  We love crocs- all of my kids have a pair as their summer play shoes! We have a small farm and these are perfect- they can step in anything and hose off without a problem, wear them to play in the creek or the pond (if they come off in the pond they float and are easily retrievable!), and the versatility of wear with the heel strap makes it great for super active kids that like to run. I purchased this pair for my oldest, and as usual they are slightly bigger but we expected that. Great product.

The advice is to go a size down, but I suggest going a size up!
",elliot :-),5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I love these shoes! Crocs are silly looking yes, but that is what I love about them! I'm writing this review mainly just to note that in the description, it advises that if you're a half size to go a size down, since crocs can be large fitting/wide. However, this wasn't the case for me. I'm a size 7 and 1/2 in womens, so I chose a size 7, but I had to return it as I found it too tight fitting. If you fit size 8 converse just fine, then you most likely have feet similar to mine, so I'd recommend going a size up! Even without socks, it was uncomfortable enough for me to have to return it for a larger size.Besides the size issue, the shoes are wonderful! The coupon is also a great deal.

Some things seem off .
",Shanese ,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I ordered the yellow (beautiful , bright color by the way) ! The shoe itself fits PERFECTLY!! I ordered my regular size and the fit is right on. My only concern is (after reading previous reviews about counterfeit shoes) after comparing them to my other CROCS (whom I know for a fact are authentic) , things does seem a little off. I’m not sure if it means anything . But my other crocs read “Made in Vietnam” and these read “Made in China” ... which has me a little confused. Again , IT MAY BE NOTHING !! I just had to point out that fact . Which that may be why these looks a little cheaper than my originals . They look kinda like they were RUSHED on the assembly line when you’re looking at them closely  . Other than this . They’re great ! Great color , size , fit . I’m definitely gonna keep them !

",Alex D,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Anyone going on deployment needs Crocs, so I got these for $30ish. They came in a plastic Crocs bag in new condition. I put them on and immediately felt weird, but you eventually get over your loss of dignity, as everyone else owns a pair. When they’re new, they have these nubs that you put your feet onto that stab you with every step, but in a good way. Every other shoe brand says I’m a 9M, but Crocs think I’m a 10M, so make sure you get a size up for anything from this brand. There is no slip resistance, so watch yourself in the shower. The Off-road ankle strap seems durable and the whole shoe feels like it will hold up to any challenge. The top is flexible and will stretch.

Perfect! Order up a size; especially if you wear a half size!
",A,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  *I bought the charms separately on amazon; highly recommend(never too old for charms!!)**I normally wear a size women’s 9 (sometimes 9.5) but I bought a size 10. I ALWAYS recommend going up a size in crocs. These are not sneakers that need to be snug. You don’t want these to be tight at all! These are relaxing shoes. If they are snug, your feet will rub, get smelly, and create sores from the rubbing. And my foot just barely hangs over the edge when I bought a size 9 a while ago.They have a strap on the back to help keep your feet in place (I call that putting them in 4 wheel drive), or you can flip the strap to the front (shown in my picture). I prefer it that way because it’s easy to slide on and off like slippers.I personally wear this pair to work.I bought different colors for day to day wear.They are SUPER easy to clean! I typically use a disinfectant wipe; but you can use all purpose cleaner a towel, spray Lysol, wash them in the sink with dish soap, etc. But do NOT use bleach!

Surprisingly Great
",MIGirl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I didn’t want to love Crocs. They are so boxy and ugly, but that ugliness grew on me really fast once I started wearing them. I bought them because I needed gardening shoes. My other shoes were constantly having soil and other yard debris packed into the treads and it was way too much work to clean them out. So, I decided to give a pair of Crocs a try since with the holes they should get decent airflow and I could hose them off or toss them in the washing machine as needed. So, I reluctantly bought a pair of very purple Crocs.After a week of wearing my new Crocs, I can say I totally get why people love these things.They have NO arch support, which for me is generally horrible but they’re so roomy that it’s more like walking barefoot than it is like wearing bad shoes.With as roomy as they are, not at all form fitting, you’d think your feet would slip and slide all over the place and you’d have to work to keep them on your feet. But they don’t. My feet stay in place and the Crocs stay on my feet just fine.Nothing sticks to them. Dirt and soil get in through the holes, but also go right back out through the holes, just leaving behind dirty feet. And nothing has stuck to the treads: dirt, soil, mud, dog poop, compost… nothin’. They also don’t stay wet long at all. I had to go out in the pouring rain and they were dry by the time I walked through my house.And, with all the holes, there’s great air circulation, just about as good as sandals. This was my first pair of Crocs; I doubt it will be my last. They’re too comfortable and convenient not to love them.

Great, love them.
",Chazman1946,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  This is the second pair of Crocs I bought in the last month. Never owned a pair and always thought they looked ugly, and never understood why there was this attraction to them.I have wide feet, 12 4E, I was skeptical the 12 M size was going to be too tight.  They fit perfectly, I guess because they are wide to start off with, although if I had narrow feet I probably wouldn't be too happy with them.The things are super comfortable and around the house, I wear them with strap up front so I can just slip them off and on like a pair of slippers.  When I go out I wear the strap in the rear to secure them completely on my feet.They may not be the most beautiful pair of footwear, but I have worn them out dancing, even playing golf. They're great, that's why I bought this second pair.I was also skeptical about the little knobs on the inside of the shoe, but these I found kind of massage your feet and make them feel good.

Raised letters that say Hecho in Mexico on strap hurt the backs of my feet, this is new
",Aurora,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have been wearing crocs for years. I have had many pairs of this kind that I ordered. However, this time I bought them, I put them on, and wore them for a few hours. And I was like why are the backs of my ankles hurting? It felt like something was rubbing the backs of my ankles. I tried to ignore it, but ultimately I became worried it was going to rub the skin off my ankles so I took the shoes off and looked at them. The reason why the strap hurts is because it says ""Hecho in Mexico"" in RAISED lettering!! The letters on the inside of the strap are raised and keep rubbing the backs of my ankles as I walk. So I have concluded that the only way to wear these shoes safely is to move the strap from the back ankle area to the top of the shoe, which I don't like. Why did you have to do this, Crocs??? Please stop putting the raised letters of Hecho in Mexico on the inside strap because it hurts my skin. I want Crocs to stop making the shoes like this, because it sucks if my shoes hurt because of this. Why?? Please remove this lettering off the inside straps because you're causing pain to your customers.

They are quick and easy to dry after getting wet, can be worn with or without short socks, are very comfortable to walk in, cushioned and arch support.  Toe width has enough room for comfortable spread with no rubbing on sides or top of toes.  I wouldn't recommend any other shoe for Disney or for sore tired feet.  Just love them!

Not the nicest looking shoe but the most comfy.
",Hannah Lynn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  As much as I'd love brown leather wingtip oxfords, they're impossible to find in womens size 5/6 in Wide Width. or anything nice looking for that matter. and I got tired of looking. When you have Cerebral Palsy, dressing is a struggle. I got to a point where I wanted something that I could put on without help, and comfortable with or without socks. Are they kinda ugly? Yeah. But it's worth it. I plan on getting two in black so they can blend in with my pants, but sometimes I enjoy colors. So far I own a Slate Grey and Navy. Both pairs were the right size (I ended up getting Womens 6. A little roomy but not too much, and i have tiny feet) Obviously they're snugger when I wear them with fuzzy socks.  These shoes are also great toe box wise. My heel is very narrow and my foot widens up to my toe box. The toe box is wide enough to where I don't feel squeezed at all, even with thick socks.When I'm travelling and the hotel doesn't have a shower seat I can wear these in the shower since I can't go barefoot. They are very easy to rinse out and dry.Even with my issue with dragging my left big toe, they're pretty sturdy. Most shoes after half a year would already have a hole and need to be replaced. I plan on getting second pairs just to have just in case, but I don't think my left shoes will wear through soon. They're not extremely supportive, I wouldn't recommend them for running, but as someone with chronic pain and weak ankle/foot muscles, these are great for around the house and walking through a bookstore.

Decent support for around the house
",K. Cunningham,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I got these on a friend's recommendation after avoiding Crocs for years. I never understood what the hype was before, but my friend insisted that if I wanted something to support my feet while doing things around the house, these would be a good choice. I am glad I gave them a chance, and am now debating on getting a second pair for wearing out.While the arch support isn't spectacular, it's a massive step up from trying to shove insoles into slippers like I was doing before. They hold their shape well so far, they fit comfortably, have a little bit of shock absorption to them, and best of all they are EASY TO CLEAN! Also if you're a bit clumsy like me, the roomy toe area makes a great buffer to prevent you from injuring yourself by stubbing your toes.They fit very well without being too tight, and stay on my feet with or without the heel strap, so I've taken to keeping the strap folded up over the front to get in and out of them more easily.I'm definitely a fan now that I've tried them.

  As strange as crocs look, they sure are comfortable. I wear these bad boys every single day.

They are also able to withstand different environments, whether you’re walking on sharp surfaces such as rocks or glass. I’ve also tested them on slippery surfaces, surprisingly haven’t fallen yet!I get a lot of compliments on my crocs, especially when I’m wearing my scrubs.

  Overall, I've been very happy with my Classic Crocs.  I wear a size 7.5 shoe and I own several pairs of Croc Flip-Flops/Sandals which I ordered in a size 8 (happy I did for those).  However, many have said the Classic Clogs run large.  After sizing my foot according to the chart it still said for me to order a size 8.  I went against that and ordered a size 7 based on the reviews saying they run large.  I'm so glad I ordered down a size! They fit how my normal shoe would because I do not like any loose feeling when I'm walking.  Even with my socks on they fit great and are surprisingly comfortable.  I can walk long distances without any foot fatigue.  Only minor negative I would say is my feet get warm in them.  I don't notice it until I sit down when having them on.  Other than that I'll definitely be purchasing additional pairs and love how easy they are to clean!

Heavenly Feel. Massages the soles of my feet and keeps them from itching.
",Synthia,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  My first pair of Crocs just arrived and after wearing them one day, I am in love!I got these shoes because my feet itch in other shoes during the summer time. The cloth interior  of regular shoes trap sweat and bacteria. It  is just not sanitary.I can wash, wipe and sanitize the inside of my Crocs every day if I want in order to avoid that issue.I intend to wear these barefoot, outside, after the shower and anytime I want because I can still keep them sanitary.Now, for the feel: Ooh, la la! I love the textured insides. The little raised bumps and spikes inside the shoes poke the bottom of my feet, giving them a massage and relieving tension when I walk. This feels so good!Often my feet are tired and stressed and I have to press them against something or do exercises to relieve them. But now, Crocs can destress my feet for me while I walk.Also, I like that I can wear the straps over the top of my feet like a slide-in slipper or behind my heel . It's so convenient to have two types of styles.  When I put the straps behind my heel, I can feel the spikes inside the shoes better so that is my preferred style after a long day.These shoes are very roomy. At first I thought they were too wide, but I like that there's so much room.The only concern was that one strap is a little looser than the other. Since most factories have standardization, I questioned whether I was sent a knock-off or the real thing. I hope these are real. Either way, they feel super good and I intend to get several pair.Now, let me get off the internet and go walk in my Crocs because my feet want to play!

Roomy Fit
",konmarikhadija,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  It doesn't say so on the description here but these crocs are labeled as 'Roomy Fit' so they are huge.  It's a little weird but it seems like Crocs fit differently depending on where they are made. I'm a 7.5 and initially opted for a 5/7 but found that it was too tight for my toes when I put the strap on the back of my heel. This was on a pair made in Mexico. However I have a 5/7 that was made in Vietnam that fit fine with or without the strap. So for this one I decided to order a size up to make sure that it will be comfortable no matter where it was made. The pair I received was made in Vietnam but since they are 'Roomy Fit' they are way too big. The color is gorgeous so I'm going to return these and order my regular size again and hope for the best.Update:I received the 5/7 today and they’re perfect! Leaving the review at 4 stars because it really should be in the description that these are roomy fit.

My go-to comfy shoes
",ResearchAddict,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Crocs were born in my hometown, well the town I lived in the longest, I should say. At first, I thought they looked hideous, kinda still do, to be honest. They make people's feet look huge. Yet, when I tried a pair at my daughter's house, because she insisted it was like walking on clouds, and I had a very sore, broken foot, I couldn't believe how comfortable they were. I began to sing a new tune! I became all about comfortable shoes. And this ics coming from a woman who's family owned several chains of shoes stores for 77 years! High-end fashion shoes, mid-range casual boots and shoes, and lower end shoes too. We never had anything like these in our stores though (they hadn't been invented yet). We did sell Jellies (remember those?) in the summer in the low-priced shops, but Crocs are so much nicer.I have owned and worn out 5 pairs of the classic Crocs in various colors, as well as 2 pairs of the winter lined ones. I just bought more classics, in more colors, because why not wear comfy shoes? I wear them gardening and when I'm being super casual. I keep a couple pairs as indoor slippers too. Will have to order a new pair for winter soon.

Good Buy!
",Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  A little about me so you can categorize my review:  I live in Hawaii where Crocs and Bermuda shorts are de rigueur.  I wear dress shoes at weddings and restaurants, but I have seen people wear them there without being asked to leave.I go through about 2 pairs a year (yes, Hawaii, ha ha).I actually expected to buy a pair at our local slipper shop where I normally get them, but I was shocked to find they had gone to $45/pair!  I whipped out my phone & showed the lady they are $26 on Amazon.  She smiled and said she would help me find a good fit so I could order from Amazon (Hawaii has pretty girls with pretty manners).I was apprehensive because of other reviews, but my pair fit as well as any, and the rubber seemed about average.  The toe box and width were a little more generous and the arch support was a little flatter, but overall, fit is as expected.  The tread on the new Crocs is more robust.  That is a plus for Hawaii because it rains everyday here, and slippery footwear are dangerous, especially on steps, sidewalks, and roads without dedicated walking paths.  My previous pairs were made in Mexico; these were made in China.  (Maybe these were made more with Haole feet in mind.)  The pic shows my existing (Mexico) Croc on the left, and the new (China) Croc on the right.Good: price, fit, wear, appearanceBad: (none)Summary: II like them. I am going to order another pair for our other house.-Larry

Everyone was telling me that Crocs were that answer but, I was thinking how could a shoe for such a little price help my feet?

Finally I caved and figured at the price, I could just throw them away like the rest of the EXPENSIVE shoes I had purchased. Let me tell you what a glorious feeling right from the start!!!

Awesome
",dasn0wman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These guys are amazing.  For years, I avoided them despite of the hype some time ago.  The funny thing is that I was always looking for a shoe that can work as a slipper because that would be so practical for traveling.The regular clogs don’t have enough backing on the heel to be a shoe.  I got these slippers once and tried to use them as shoes but they have no soles and so very uncomfortable to walk on hard surfaces and got really wet when it was raining.  The soft shoes have too much backing on the heel and so cannot be used as a slipper.Enter the Croc’s innovative design that has a movable heel strap so it’s a slipper when you’re at home and a shoe when you’re moving around.In the picture, they look solid so you know they will work on hard surfaces.  My concern was if they are comfortable because it looks like hard plastic but it is really some rubber or silicone material so quite soft and comfy.The only thing is the sizing is off.  I wear 9.5 and got a 10 but I should have gotten a 9.  It is loose but not really an issue except if you plan to drive wearing them.  I have a manual car and I stalled the car when I drove it wearing these for first time.I don’t think looks is a problem and very subjective.  In this case, they become so iconically ugly that many ppl think they’re beautiful now.

  Was looking for a new pair of Crocs to replace my older pair and after going to the outlet store and finding nothing i decided to just order them from amazon found the style i liked and a color and they had them in my size ordered them i have had other pairs of Crocs in the past and knew what i was getting so didn't think twice about not getting them after the first week of getting a new pair of Crocs and telling myself im going to keep them i take and remove the straps and side buttons to get them to fit the way i like them and they are mostly my house shoes and as of lately i take them to work and switch out of my work shoes and into them for the drive home overall they are comfortable to wear the colors pop and they are true to size and you dont have to go up a size which is what i do when i am looking for regular shoes but not with Crocs they fit right and i love the feel

OMG, I am now a total Crocs Convert !!!
",T.H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  A friend bought me a pair, and I was HOOKED.  So I ordered this pair via Amazon in the Ice Blue color, in my normal sneaker-size women's US 7.  They fit true to size.  I'm so glad I discovered Crocs...  They are so comfy, light & airy, with great cushioning for walking all day long.  I used to think they were just plastic gardening shoes, or just comfy clogs for nurses & doctors.  But NOW I am seeing Crocs everywhere.... They have become a highly sought-after fashion item!  I also ordered the medium pink color (via Amazon), so now I have 3 pair of Crocs.  The bright fun colors make me smile, they are actually ""in fashion"" right now, and my feet couldn't be happier.PS... I advise to google them & check out the prices from various department stores, shoes stores, etc, & compare those prices with Amazon's pricing.  Although I must say this seller shipped pretty fast, had a competitive price, AND has the largest assortment of colors to choose from!  Great purchase.  -- Thank you :)

Needs a little break in time to get a great fit!
",ajk170,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Ok, so I never thought I would wear Crocs but after years and years of hype through movies, online, word of mouth, internet, and personal friends, I figure I'd try them.  And they were all correct! These really are great feeling things for my feet.  They aren't cool looking (at least not for an American non-hipster male) but boy are the nice feeling and functional. Specifically on function, I was looking for a camp slipper that I could slip on around the campsite/RV/Campground/lodge/cabin and walk outside without putting on boots or sneakers.  Sandals are ok if you're a boy or when on an island beach but anywhere else, nope.  Moccasins are ok, but typically they do not have a hard sole.  So camp slippers with hard soles are becoming a thing but they are typically over $80 and at that point they are just a really cheap boot.  So Crocs help fill the void and niche for a camp slipper.  Of course, Crocs are not insulated but inside I usually have socks on so these are perfect, esp in non cold months or climates because with socks or no socks I can slip the feet right into these things. And so far, without socks these things do not make the feet hot (at least not mine) so not a lot of foot sweat and the resulting stink.  What I have learned is that these things do stretch, at least a little which is good.  I ordered a size 9 ( i wear a 9.5 in boots/drewss shoes [Danner, Allen Edmonds, Sperry) and tennis shoes are a 10 [Nike, Adddis, Chucks]) and when they first arrived, the left one fit perfectly but the right one seemed a tad small since a couple of my toes were just barely bumping up against the front of the croc.  Plus I kinda thought my heals were right on the back edge of the croc but despite this , they were still pretty comfy but not great. Plus,the first few days of ownership and wearing without socks, the tops and sides of my feet were getting a few hot spots from rubbing. But nonetheless,  I continued to wear them and powered through hoping they would get better and rather quickly (within a couple weeks) with casual wearing these feel better (my right toes no longer barely touches the front and no hot spots) but I still feel like my heels are on the back edges of the crocks so I think they maybe too short.  But I really like that they fit snug and never feel like a flip-flop that could slide right off my feet, even when barefoot in them. Plus the nubs have a great massaging effect - super sensitive feet may not like it but the nubs are soft and with socks i can't feel them. But because of how good these feel, I want to believe the size 10 will feel better and as a result I have a size 10 on the way.If you can find these in the store, I would try on several pairs of the same size just to see if they fit slightly different due to variances in the QA/QC.  I think a person would be able to find the perfect fit in the store, esp. if they are between sizes like I am.  if my size 9 were just a tad larger they would be perfect.  As it is, I'm expecting the size 10 to be a little too big and slip around but I'm hoping they will work and not slide around but I expect them to feel just a little bit better, otherwise I'll stick to the smaller size due to a potentially better fit.

",Kelley P.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I know, I know... they are the ""Given up on life"" shoe.  They are ugly as sin.  I know this.  But I also know that when I am in hour 16 of standing for the work I do, they are a lifesaver and I'm not thinking about my feet hurting.  I'm thinking about how much I doubt my career choice at that moment, but my feet are fine.  I'm thinking about crying as the sun is coming up and I still have another two or three hours to go, but my feet are good to go. And when I finally crawl into bed, every part of me is calling me names, but my feet are still my friend.Still not as bad as wearing slippers to the grocery store....

Better Than My Old Ones, But....
",HonestGuy3017,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are the genuine Crocs clogs, and are better than my old ones, which I purchased at a famous discount store chain. (Take a look at my photos.  Depending on what device you are using, the photos will show up in a different order.  I have two photos of the Crocs by themselves; one shows the excellent tread on the sole, and the other shows the bumps/points inside.  Two photos show the Crocs side-by-side with my old worn-out store brand clogs.)  But the Crocs are not an entirely unmixed blessing!  First, the Crocs cost over 3x the price of the chain store clogs.  Winner: chain store clogs.  Second, the Crocs are made in Vietnam,  while the chain store ones are made in USA. BIG win for the chain store clogs!  But the Crocs have advantages, too.  First, the Crocs fit as advertised. If you wear a size 11, order a size 11. (These do not come in Wide width. If you need a wider width, consider ordering the next 1/2 size up.  For instance, I wear a men's 10-1/2 Wide in a regular shoe. I ordered these Crocs in men's size 11, and they fit perfectly.)  The chain store clogs run small, so I had to get a size 12 of them. Winner: Crocs. Second, the Crocs sole has better tread and therefore better traction.  (See photos.)  Winner: Crocs. Third, the Crocs come with a strap that you can put around your heel to keep them from slipping off (see photos again).  If you don't want to use the straps, simply fold them up over the front, out of the way.  Winner: Crocs.  Fourth, Crocs have little buttons (or points) molded into the insole that massage the soles of your feet. This may or may not be an advantage, depending on your preference. Hint: if the points bother you, try wearing socks, or thicker socks if you're already using socks. For me, the points only took about 20 minutes of walking to get used to.  NO clear winner here; which is best depends upon your preference.  The Crocs appear well made, fit well, and are very comfortable. The next question for me is, will they outlast my chain store clogs long enough to justify spending more than three times as much money, for a foreign-made product?  The main reasons I bought these are: 1.  I could not get clogs in black anymore from the chain store.  They only come in an ugly brownish-green color that is patterned to look like dead leaves! (If you are a gardener who wants your shoes to blend in with your mulch, you might prefer the chain store clogs. Me, not so much!);  and 2.  I have always wanted to try the genuine Crocs product.  Time will tell whether they were worth the extra investment.

  Alright guys, I'll admit it....I've been out of the Croc game for a good while, now. I needed some comfy shoes to wear around the house and to the lake for boating/other activities where i could get my shoes wet and not sweat it. I used to wear these bad boys in high school non-stop (yep, you guessed it...graduated a virgin, but things took a turn for the better quickly after - MOVING ON! lol). Amazon was the only place that carried a 14 like my gargantuan feet need....so i copped em up on wardrobe, just because i was skeptical about falling back in to my old ways. Oh you best believe, the second i put them on i ripped up that return label! Who could deny their ugly, all-day comfort and goodness?!?! Long story, short....haven't stopped wearing them since. They gone from ""around the house and on the boat only"" shoes to ""fine dining, church, barbeque, errands, anywhere that would make my wife embarrassed to be with me, etc."" shoes. Currently, fearful that my wife is packing her bags....may be single and alone real soon, idk....but at least i'll be comfortable in my solitude, right?! 10/10 would recommend.

Lemon Yellow Crocs.... Now I own 3 pairs in 3 fabulous colors!
",T.H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I started with the electric pink color, then the ice blue, then a lighter pink, and now these sunny-cute Lemon Yellow ones.  I never thought I'd like Crocs, but OMG they are so comfy & so cute... I have officially fallen in love with Crocs!  I wear a women's size 7 in sneakers, so that's the size I buy in Crocs, and they fit me perfectly.  I have looked at the Crocs in the shoe stores, and these Crocs from Amazon are indeed the real deal -- and the price is the same on Amazon (sometimes even lower).... plus Amazon usually has a much better selection in available colors, too.  ------  I live in S Florida where it's almost always hot and humid, so my feet love the air conditioned holes in these shoes.  I have loads of sneakers, dressy shoes, and flip flops. But some days you just wanna wear something totally cute & colorful, and comfy.  -----  Btw...  I've noticed that Crocs have become VERY fashionable & ""on trend"" lately.  I see teenage girls & grown women rockin' them in all sorts of colors.  I'm really enjoying them, and so are my grateful feet.  I can wear them 24/7 and be so comfortable.  I've gotten so many compliments on the Lemon Yellow ones already, and that's from teens to women in their 30's, 40's, 50's and up!  Apparently everyone wants to own a cute pair of colorful Crocs these days.  --- This vendor mailed mine in a hurry & they arrived fast.  I definitely recommend Crocs, and this vendor on Amazon!  And PS... Fashionable guys are rockin' Crocs too these days, and in all the colors !  It's apparently the new big thing. :)

Great Shoe
",Hippy Woman,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I’m a size 7.5. The 8 is too big. The 7 had to be broken in for 2 weeks, because it was definitely a bit small at first and the outer edge almost touched the back of my foot.But here’s the thing about Crocs. If you get them too big, the arch support won’t work. Your foot isn’t supposed to swim in these. It’s definitely up to the user to decide their fit preference.As for my opinion: If you want a bigger fit, go a size (or in my case, a half-size) up.If you want a more “custom” fit, order true to size (or in my case, a half-size down) and break them in. The rubber loosens up a bit and conforms to your foot.I do think that this model of Crocs has gotten progressively smaller in fit over the past 4 years. So the Crocs of old are a darn sight bigger than today’s sizes.I have wide, duck feet, and the normal width was fine for me.The interior rubber “spikes” inside have also gotten stronger and more effective. So much that it did take me a few weeks to break them in, because the spikes were QUITE spikey for my taste. It calms down after some wear.My husband couldn’t handle the spikes because he has soft feet with zero callus (lucky duck). So if you have sensitive feet, these might need to be worn with some socks until things soften up.

Perfect fit with plenty of width!
",JR,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I’ve waited years to finally spend money on foam shoes. Now that I did, I don’t know that I’ll ever be without a pair again! I checked the fit style on Crocs website before I bought- they have fit descriptions in each style of shoe which described the general feel and how “roomy” or relaxed they are.These are the most roomy shoes they offer. I typically wear a 10.5 men’s, but usually need a wide size. I ordered the 10 size and these are a very comfortable fit. Plenty of room, without feeling too loose or like they’re going to fall off my feet.I wear these around the house for added support, and will wear them out fishing when the weather gets warmer.Tip: I have worn them with some thin socks and I find that keeps my meet foot bottom from getting sweaty in them.

   Ok ok, I know what you are all thinking... ""CROCS ARE SO UGLY THEY LOOK LIKE CLOWN SHOES!"" It is no secret that for years crocs have been violated for being big and a but um, unique to say the least but these shoes are super super comfortable! Staying home I realized my chanclas were not making the cut and decided to shop for new stay at home footwear, leading me to buying crocs. The ones in the video are ice blue, they are beautiful and comfortable! As someone with arched feet, you will not go wrong with purchasing these. After wearing them relentlessly for weeks it was super noticeable just how unsupportive other brands are with feet arches. Crocs though, they've got your back. They are of a rubbery plastic, so your feet will sweat at first, but after a while, at least for me, they'll stopped sweating. Overall this was worth the purchase since they serve as stay at home, out door and water shoes. They are true to size, however, you may consider sizing up if you want them to be roomy. Overall they're good. (as a size reference I used my Nike slides), I hope this helps!

So Light and Comfortable!
",DL Nuggets,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I made fun of my husband for wearing them but then I tried his and they seemed comfortable. Low and behold I got mine and these are glorious. I don't care if people think they are silly. I'm rocking them out because they work for what I need. These are like slippers but much lighter. I can slip them right on super easily. I can wear them with or without socks. When I want to go out to the shed outside or to the mailbox I just throw these on. If it's rainy outside, no prob! They stay on really well but if I need a little extra security I just simply throw the strap to the back around my heel and put them in what my husband refers to as four-wheel drive. Definitely recommend these but not if you're lame.

",C,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I love the ones I bought several years ago. The problem is, the old ones are a very comfortable fit and say 45 on the bottom. The new ones say men's 11 which is supposed to equate to the European 45-46 so I assumed that they would be the same. they are visibly smaller and fit tighter. I may return them and get a men's 12. When I saw the Men's 11, I had reservations but figured the European number stamped into the shoe would be  a better gauge of size. Not so.

Ugliest Shoes Ever, But...

  When I first saw someone wearing a pair of Crocs, I remember thinking, “I would not be caught dead in shoes that ugly.”  However, after borrowing a pair to walk home from the beach (my fabric river shoes are impossible to wear if they get sand in them), I was sold.  I have bunions the size of walnuts on both feet - plus the sores from the fabric shoes - and was able to walk the mile home from the beach in the Crocs with no trouble.  The pair I borrowed were a boy’s  Junior 5 and they fit like the Women’s size 7.  I will not make fun of Crocs ever again.

  Really great for the tropical areas of Hawaii.  Constantly getting these wet/ full of mud and rinsing them.  Also good for Hawaii because everyone takes their shoes of to go indoors - they slip on easily.  Not super comfortable, as people often say of Crocs, and not very supportive at all.  I might think of buying these again to wear in Chicago, because of ease of use, but not sure.  If you wear an 8 or 8.5, I'd definitely suggest following other reviewer's recommendations, and sizing up.  A 9 worked perfectly for me, but at first even the 9 felt a tiny bit short.  I think they do stretch, but like I said, I wore them constantly in wet weather, which I believe helps with the stretch.

Great deal on an extremely practical piece of ugly footwear!
",Laverne Otto-Phitre,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Rare to find this brand at the Amazon price I paid - wanted a clog with heel strap so I could safely drive back & forth to the local aquatic center.  I wasn't excited about the glossy black appearance, but since I only wear them to drive from my garage to the pool, walk about 200 feet across hot concrete, stick them in a locker while I swim, then reverse the process to go home, I can overlook my own fashion faux pas.  The heel strap keeps them properly positioned on my feet while driving, and the drain holes in the toes make them great for poolside.  I have falling arches & these make the walk from car to poolside & back so much less painful than foam flip-flops - and as stated before, I feel confident driving my car (automatic transmission) whereas with flip-flops, I'd change in & out of socks & shoes, while my kids wait for me to get the car started & the A/C going.  If these last half as long as my old Crocs Mammoth clogs (10+ years so far & still have a little bit of tread on the soles), then these are the best deal in footwear for my Fashion Tone-Deaf Curmudgeon Community.

Just purchased a gray pair for my husband, and they look really nice on me, too :)  Might have to order myself a pair of gray soon :)It fits perfectly, except the opening is a little bit smaller than the pairs I bought about 10 years ago.  Yes, I stocked up on them, back then, when I found the white ones locally.  BUT, the good news is, if I order a size larger, it's now a perfect fit.  Found that out when I ordered that pair for my husband, after he saw my newest pair.I also love the fact that you can just wear them in the shower, or throw them in the washer to keep them clean.It's a WONDERFUL shoe_like none other !

",Emma,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Who could say anything bad about a croc? It's one of those shoes where I feel like a significant number of people know what size they are in crocs, but just in case: I am usually between an 8-9 in shoes. These run about half a size larger, although I can wear both an 8 and a 9 in crocs, I like the way the 8 looks better. If you have wide feet and that's a deciding factor for you in getting the larger sizes, you don't have to worry about that because of the wideness of crocs. I'm so glad these are back in style. The white ones especially are a perfect staple shoe for summer. I wouldn't hike in them, but they would be fine as an everyday shoe for sure. They also make a good house slipper for going inside and outside too. we stan

They're so comfortable, supportive, light, and handy! I can wear them out to the garden and then just hose them off. They're quiet enough to wear around the house while the kids are sleeping.

  I have steered clear of buying crocs, as I assumed it would ""show my age"" but, having just turned 43, I think I no longer care. I am outdoors working in the yard many hours per day and my pale skin was cooking in my regular uncomfortable $4 flip flops. That, and needing arch support, my feet were aching. Now, my gorgeous grass green crocs protect my fragile skin. The crocs are SO comfy and sturdy I've begun wearing them on the regular for NON outdoor gardening and pool cleaning activities. Even as I precariously balance on the slippery rock formations around the pool, the crocs grip and keep me from sliding into the pool hilariously. 10/10 will buy more. Perhaps a rainbow version?

Must Buy!
",Tee H,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I was pretty skeptical about purchasing this shoe, due to the conflicting opinions in fashion.  What is more important, style or comfort?  Well, if you were to ask me that question two weeks ago, my answer would be style without a bit of hesitation.  However, after working eight-plus hour shifts, five days a week, standing only, my mindset – and answer to that question – has definitely changed.  I thought my Nike sneakers would cut it, but I soon realized they provided no support, no natural curvature for the foot to follow, no air circulation.  My knees and feet began to kill, and I decided it might be a good idea to do some research.Clogs.  Clogs?  I know I wanted more practical shoes, but clogs are just not suited for my nineteen-year-old self.  I mean, I still wanted something relatively cute.  But was that possible?  I kept scrolling through the shopping tab of Google, until I saw this pair of crocs.  Now, I remember I sported a bright orange pair in middle school, but I think I outgrew that stage.  Wait, they have a white pair.  Much more mature color.  I decided to take the risk, after all, my I owed it to my feet.Not only did these crocs pull my whole scrub uniform together – I mean what screams healthcare more than scrubs and crocs? – but I managed an entire shift with 99% less foot and knee pain than my previous sneakers had caused.  Another plus, they are “not only the most comfortable shoes, but also easy to clean just using soap and water and allowing for a quick dry.”  Because one of my duties as a pharmacy technician is to pour liquids, it is easy to spill on your shoes.  But, because of the synthetic material, I am able to grab a wet paper towel and wipe the mess right off.  But wait, there’s more.  I’m sure everyone can relate to their feet getting sweaty in sneakers, especially if you are moving around all day.  Well, crocs solve that problem for you.  The holes provide circulation and leave your feet as dry as ever.I totally agree with and support this review!“There is a moderate arch support. I have low arches and my sister-in-law has extremely high arches; neither of us feel like more support is needed” As arch support was one of my main concerns, I can assure that crocs also leave me feeling like my feet are supported properly. I highly recommend purchasing this product, as it has changed my work day experience.  I no longer suffer with severe feet and joint pain that is caused by flat shoes.  These crocs provide just the right amount of support and maintain comfort with the foamy cushion.  If standing on your feet sounds like the majority of your days, then crocs are the shoes that will change your life.  Especially with the color assortment, there’s a shoe to match every outfit!

Excellent for pool deck, locker room, and at home!  Good arch support.
",Nina Jordan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Excellent sandal for walking on the pool deck and in locker rooms!  Good arch support!  Very comfortable. Easy to slip on and off while standing. Nice big toe box. I also wear them at home as slippers, as shoes in warm weather, on grass, on docks, and for canoeing, and kayaking. Lift your foot up and the water drains, out so your feet do not stay wet. On colder days I wear them with socks. I have worn them for many years and I keep buying more of same. Their usefulness and comfort wins out over lack of beauty due to bulky look. I hope they keep making this same classic sandal.  I have to replace them because extended wear on the pool deck concrete smooths the bottom making them slippery. Otherwise they last a long time. I wear them 5 or 6 days a week for hours at the pool while teaching swimming, life-guarding, roving, and while showering in locker room after swimming.

I LOVE MY CROCS.
",Rachel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I was so excited to get the cyan blue crocs on super sale. These are the comfiest shoes ever. The dots on the soles massage your feet, they provide great arch support, they’re such a cute color, and it’s finally long enough past the initial croc trend that they’re ironically stylish again. 10/10 recommend for beach days, days at the pool, rainy days, regular days, lazy days, winter days with socks, or whatever else to want to wear them with. They definitely run large, so try on a friend’s or try them on in the store first if possible. But snag yourself a pair, you won’t regret it!

I’ve actually finished shopping before and then realized that I went to the store in my garage Crocs lol.I have huge feet and I wear size 11 in all shoe styles so that’s what I got for these. They are a bit roomy in the width and length, but they still don’t seem bulky when they’re on, my foot does not slide around inside the shoes, and it means I can wear my thick comfy socks under them!I want more! Maybe one pair for working out in the yard. And maybe some lined ones to use as slippers. I definitely want some in cooler colors next!

These are now my favorite kick-around shoe - even went shopping in Walmart with them and they turned out to be comfy.
",S. Petty,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Where have these been all my life?  I first discovered a cheap copy of these at Walmart, and I loved how they fit and how easily they slip on and off.  So I was pleased to find the original brand here on Amazon.  I live in the desert, and our home is kept on the warm side too, so I definitely need models (like this classic model) with the holes in the side and top - the one thing I didn't like about my cheap knock-offs is they didn't have those holes, and my feet (with or without socks) were uncomfortably hot and clammy inside the house.  Another good feature is being able to toss the shoes into a bucket of soapy water to clean them after slogging in the mud outside.For me, the strap is crucial.  If I fold the strap up to the front out of the way, my heel sometimes slips out over the back end of the shoe, so I hope they never eliminate the strap!My feet are 11 1/2, and very wide (12 4E New Balance 408s fit well), and the size 12 Crocs fit good - I am going to try a size 13 next for kicking around the house and see if they are even easier to slip on/off.

  I know what you're thinking, these things are ugly and look ridiculous, and you're not wrong. What grown man would wear these. Well, turns out, this grown man would. When these things first hit the market, I was with everyone else making fun of them. But here's the thing, my brother is a cook, on his feet all day, and he wears crocks for cooks (don't worry, they're different than these, not open, so no foot fungus in your food) and he convinced me to try them because he swore they were the most comfortable pair of shoes he's ever had. So I finally broke down and bought a pair, and you know what, he was right. These things are great. I slip them on when I've got errands to run, light yard work, or sometimes when it's nice, just out and about, and they are very comfortable, and durable too. Get em wet, no problem, wear them with or without socks, still comfortable. Yes I look like a goof with them on, and I thought that would bother me, but it turns out my sense of shame is way lessened by how comfortable they are. If I thought I could get away with it, I'd wear them everywhere during the warmer months.

  So I’ll admit I always felt crocs were ugly & ridiculous. I thought no matter how comfortable they may be it just wasn’t worth stooping to that level... but then I reached the age where comfort & convenience became more important than vanity. I needed something to wear during the summer that he slightly more protection from itchy grass than flip flops but was cooler & didn’t require socks like tennis shoes so I caved and bought these crocs. Vowing to never wear them in public.Well I’m here to say I freakin’ love these shoes. They’re comfy and surprisingly durable. They have enough support that my feet aren’t sore at the end of the day even after walking all over our property doing chores. They exceeded my expectations and I will probably buy another pair when I wear these out. But just for the record still not wearing them to town.

Great fit and fun color
",Stephanie H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  My old crocs finally came apart after many years of use, and I decided to invest in another pair to wear to the pool and around the house. These fit just like my old ones. They are snug enough to stay to on without the back strap down and loose enough in the toes to be comfortable. The nubby inside is not really uncomfortable, but not as nice feeling as a smooth insole would be. On the other hand, my bare feet would stick to a smooth plastic sole. . I do like that I can put my wet feet into them when I get out of the pool and I don't slip around in them. I love the color (turquoise)! While crocs aren't really a fashion statement, they are ok for a quick, casual trip to the grocery store or the postoffice. I'm happy with my purchase.

  Crocs are not the fashion statement of the decade, this is true. However(!), their staying power has everything to do with how functional and durable they are. Going out to get the mail, take out the trash, quick walk with the dog, they are quick on/quick off and more comfortable than they should be.Mine kept disappearing so I bought my wife her own pair. Problem solved. Sidenote: Mine are probably 6 years old and have been used far, far harder than any pair of shoes should be. They have paint on them, gouges from who knows what, are faded and don't look very good at all, but they strap is still completely intact and they are still very comfortable.

But maybe your old ones wore out and you're at the everything for $5 store and you buy the crappy ones, and you just end up forgetting how great and different real crocs are. If you need extra room in the toe area to use toe separators, or you have wide feet, and/or you have some foot issues with pain, CROCS can be a saver for your feet.

  I've always made fun of crocs. Several years ago, I began to see their utility when it comes to camping. They are lightweight, easy to put on, easy to wash off, and most importantly... compatible with thick socks. But I still didn't buy myself a pair.I've been through 2 or 3 pairs of Croc Sexii flip flop sandals in the last few years, and I love them.So when Halloween rolled around last year, instead of ordering or making some silly one-use shoe covers for my Untitled Goose costume, I bought some bright orange crocs. It took a while to get used to the feeling of my foot being encased by solid plastic, but they're pretty comfortable.I had 2 pairs of flip flops break recently, and my crocs have since become my house shoes. Also one of my younger co-workers (who is all about fancy sneakers) is now wearing white crocs n socks to work every day, so... maybe they are cool now? Maybe?Also I ran a mile in them once at the end of a 5k fun run.

  I purchased these for easy slip ons to go outside with my toddler.  We are usually in our backyard playing with water.  THESE ARE AMAZING FOR THAT!  I am so happy I joined the crocs club and I can't believe I didn't join the club sooner.  Below are the pros for these:1. They are great for people who have wide feet (like me)2. Perfect for easy slip on and run outside.3. Great for the beach, pool, any water activity.4. You can easily slip them on and/or you can put the back strap down and your foot is a little more secure.5. Easy to clean - If you have a colored pair (like me) and they get a little dirty you can use soap and water rub on them and they look brand new again.Cons -1. If you bend your foot and/or crouch down they can leave a little crease in the shoe.

  I’m a late adapter to Crocs.  Arrived yesterday.  Initial reaction was the shoes were too long and wide, so I reluctantly put them back in the bag and started to return them.  Something urged me to actually try them on again.  I used the heel strap, walked around the house, then the yard, and next thing I knew, I wore them the rest of the day and long into the night. Eventually, I tried them without the heel strap and found they were just as secure and comfortable. I canceled the return request. Crocs are just different beasts; like Birkenstock’s or my Kälso Earth Shoes.  For me, there was a brief learning curve/familiarization period.  I’m pleased with the Crocs.  Totally what I expected.  Comfortable.  Like walking on my Gel-Pro kitchen mats wherever I go.  I just didn’t appreciate that it would take a bit to get used to a new (to me) style of foot wear.

  Use a Dremel type tool with a 1/2"" diameter coarse sanding drum to carve out a relief for a plantar wart- otherwise the ""nubs"" inside will greatly pain you!

Once the treads are worn away, they are REAL slippery on smooth wet or merely damp surfaces.  I used the above Dremel rig to cut new grooves as treads in my old ones.Without socks, your feet will sweat a good deal, or at least it is more noticeable to me.  I just slip then off if I am stationary, so,  driving is the only time it bothers me- YMMV..Overall, they are a great value unless you go with sandals.

He is a shoe hound, and ecstatic they are the only white shoes he has that are easy to keep clean and white, lol. He usually wears a size 13 sneaker but the 12 in crocs fits him best. So if you’re iffy or half size, I’d say go down a size.

Fabulous replacement for my 13 y.o. Crocs Original Clogs
",allison_m_funkonovo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are a fabulous replacement to my original Croc clogs from 2006. The fit is more streamlined than my old pair. Not as wide from side to side. No pinching, slipping or stubbing. The ice blue color is exactly as pictured. It's not Turquoise or Aqua Marine blue. I wear size 8 medium (a 6 medium in mens). This clog is unisex. So glad I didn't have to buy them more expensive elsewhere. If you have very wide feet, I would consider ordering a different Crocs clog. Did I mention how comfortable and supportive they are? Important for bad backs, necks, foot problems. I wear mine as house slippers.

Shoulda listened to hubby years ago about these Crocs
",Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  So my husband has been trying to get me to buy a pair of Crocs for years. He practically lives in his. I just couldn’t get past the looks of them. Well I finally gave in and bought this pair. Oh my what have I been missing? They are so comfortable, and easy to slip on. You can get them as dirty as you want in the garden and then you just wash them off.  They provide good air flow so your feet don’t get sweaty. What more could you want in a pair of shoes? Ok so I probably couldn’t get away with going to a wedding in them, but wish I could, cause I’d have the most comfortable feet on the dance floor! I love my Crocs and are starting to actually think they’re kind of cute. I shoulda listened to hubby years ago!

  These are so so comfortable - as recommended.  A great purchase and investment for any person.  I would and will buy more.  I was given a word of mouth recommendation for Crocs from a woman with feet problems from years of work on her feet.  I hesitated at first thinking do I need these given flip flops, sneakers etc.  I was not prepared for the little massage/stimulation like nodules inside which are great too.  I can't think of how anyone would not get a lot of wear and relief out of these shoes, particularly anyone who works on their feet.  At the moment working in long shifts on concrete these are like a little foot massage and relief in between.  TRUE TO WEBSITE IMAGES FOR SLATE PURCHASE.

  Yes, I used to hate these and thought they were the ugliest shoe ever. Swore in high school that I would never get a pair. I’m now 26 and now that I’ve hit my quarter life crisis, I found myself ordering a pair. Saw my hubby wearing them and made fun of him every time I saw him wear them. Then one day I needed to put them on to grab something outside (seeing that those were the only ones near me lol). He is a size 12 and I’m a size 6.5 so you can only imagine how huge they felt. I saw the light that day and ordered a pair of crocs.ANYWAYS here’s what you ladies wanna know about the fit:- I’m a NARROW 6.5 in women (can fit 6 in heels and 7 in Nike’s)- the site says to size up if you are a half size BUT these are already ugly enough so I took my chances and sized down.- ordered a 6 in women (Army Green) and they fit PERFECTLY.- the shoe feels SLIGHTLY tight when I put it in “4x4 mode” (as my hubby calls it lol) but it’s not enough to bug me.- hubby says they stretch out over time so there you go.I got these the day they were expected and I unfortunately have not worn any other shoe since receiving it.

  I have seen people wearing these for years and always thought they look ridiculous and couldn’t imagine how foam rubber shoes could be comfortable or durable. It’s obvious they aren’t stylish. After buying my very first pair of grass green size 15 crocs here for a crazy pre Christmas sale price of under 10$ with the free prime shipping, I’m amazed. After trying them on I no longer care how they look and I now get why they are popular. They are light durable and super comfy without feeling like you’re walking on marshmallows. In fact I was shocked how firm the foot bed is without being hard. I no longer care how they look. Not sure I would wear them to a wedding but for around the house and yard they are perfect.

Comfort! Ventilation! Durability!
",Edwin Anthony Aurelio,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  The Classic Clog line of Crocs serves my needs perfectly.  I can no longer wear normal shoes because my feet require more oxygen than those of most people, but I hate slippers and sandals (or going barefoot).  The Crocs Classic Clogs provide the ventilation I  need while still feeling like shoes, they're also very comfortable with cushioning thick soles and they're durable, lasting for a long time with no damage even after 3 years of daily use.  They're also cheap compared to others.  Yes, they're ugly, but you can get them in pretty colors to compensate, like these bright yellow ones.  For die hard Crocs fans like myself, buying one pair may lead to buying a dozen or more so be warned.  Emphasis on Classic Clog line.  The other models of shoes Crocs makes provide less ventilation and my feet aren't as comfortable in them.

Treat yourself to another Croc color.
",Amazon CustomerJim,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Great house slippers. Just read reviews that mention this. I wear a 10  EEEE, so these were perfect. I ordered the 10, and the classic crocs width was an excellent fit. If you have a narrower foot, D size and below, check out reviews on other Croc models that are narrower. Just pay attention to the number of reviews that mention whether the length is too short, this you may have to order one size larger, but the decrease in width should not be a problem for those with narrow, D and bellow. Crocs are so comfortable and easy to slip on and off I ordered another pair. And because they come in so many colors, you can order another color that pleases you, something to treat yourself to, as they are reasonably priced. Amazon’s selection is hit or miss, with many selections not available in all sizes and colors. So try Zappos. Amazon owns them anyway. And they always have free shipping and free returns.

He’s so happy that I bought them for him and “encouraged” him to wear them. They fit true to size, and he has plenty of room in them even though he has wide feet. He even loves the little “massaging things” in the soles. 😁 So glad he no longer leaves any shoes outside!!

  This is my first pair of crocs; never had the desire to own any. But now, can't imagine being without them! I needed something easy to slip into and take off when I'm down at the horse barn, feeding and cleaning corrals. Also nice that they are waterproof, unlike my old leather clogs. Excellent price, too . At first, I thought they were going to be floppy on my feet; I did purchase the size I usually wear. I wear socks with the crocs, sometimes two pair in the cooler months. They still fit just fine. I have narrow to medium width feet, wear a size 10. I like the orange because they're easy to spot wherever I've left them. Easy to clean off the dirt, either brush off or hose off; I understand they can be thrown in the washer, too. And, best of all, these crocs are as comfortable as my slippers I wear around the house. Sometimes, I forget I wore my crocs in the house, noticing sometimes hours later! Love them! And convinced my husband to order some, too! He loves his, too!

Completely Croc-ish
",Thomas K. Seibold,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  You know the drill--They're comfortable but so unstylish that they're stylish. Well, I don't think this classic style of Crocs will ever be stylish, to my eye, but we buy them for comfort and versatility, right? My old pair were so worn that they started to slip on wet surfaces so I knew it was time for replacement. These fit well, though the rear strap is now tighter than the originals I got 15 years ago. The upside is they'll stay on better than the old ones--the downside is that if you plan to use the strap, you'll have to reach down and use a finger to stretch it around the back of your foot. It's fine--just different than the old looser strap.

  I was going to buy slippers to wear in my yard and patio since it's been annoying to put shoes on whenever taking my dog outside or to take the trash out. But I went with Crocs since they are just as comfortable while also allowing me to run around if needed (ie. dog randomly feels like running around the backyard).It does its job and is comfortable enough. If anyone thinks Crocs are ugly or think they are bad purchases, they should relax. They're functionally great the way one would wear ""fat pants"" or an old t-shirt around the house.

  I’m using these as house shoes for when I move to Japan! I am a true to size women’s 9.5. I always get a size 10 on Crocs. I’ve never had classic crocs before, but I’ve heard that these feel a little big on the feet. Since all the crocs I’ve worn have been 10’s, I just got the 10 anyway. When I first put them on, I thought these were going to be too big since I have narrow feet, but once I started walking around in them, they never slipped off my feet with the heel strap. I don’t really use them without the strap. They are roomy and comfortable! I think you should try getting your regular size before thinking of sizing down. See how they fit you personally before deciding to go a full size down.

  Croc’s are super comfortable shoes for messing around the house and outside.  My wife bought an off brand as a second pair for indoors (no outside shoes in our house) that looked like Crocs but hurt her toes.

We highly recommend Crocs for bumming around the house,  or going to a water park or beach.  They are not stylish,  so probably wouldn’t recommend wearing outside of the house other than the beach.

Once my crocs arrived I immediately opened the box and started decorating. Me and my mother have the same shoe size so we are “sharing” them even though they are mine (she agreed).If you don’t own crocs I recommend that you immediately purchase a pair (or more if you are smart).The beautiful lavender color suits my skin tone very well. I will never be the same without my crocs by my side. Buy a pair of these crocs now. Sports mode is comforting knowing that your croc is safe and sound on your foot.

  I never thought I would ever own a pair but I gave in after my sister bought some. Keep in mind I made fun of her for wearing them because I didn’t understand what the hype was about. But honestly after trying hers on they where so comfortable and I just had to own a pair. I love all the colors and they are great for around the house and walking my dog, especially after a long day at work wearing my flats. Trust me if you are having second thoughts about these you need to try for yourself. The fit is great too! I’m a solid women’s  7 1/2 and I purchased a women’s size 8. My foot fits perfectly inside and they are wide so your foot feels free inside. The heel of my foot has a little room from the back of the shoe. I was worried about that but from what it seems if you’re a half size get the next size up!

",Vuong Ly,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have to be honest. I've never been a fan of the way Crocs look and have never given it a chance. I added this to my dad's collection of shoes for him to pick from. He suffers from gout so I've been buying tons and tons of shoes, trying to find him the perfect pair to alleviate the pain as much as possible when he walks. I have to say, these are quite comfy. They're waterproof, super flexible, and made of great material. I won't deduct any stars for the looks since it's a subjective matter. While these are not my dad's go-to shoes, they definitely surprised me at how nice they feel. My dad fits a size 9 and the shoe itself is true to size.Value 5/5 *****. Comfort 5/5 *****. Fit 5/5 *****. My Recommendation 5/5 *****.

  Probably hands down the most amazing thing I have put on my feet. I thought at first when I saw them they were ugly. Now that I have I pair I love them yea they are not the nicest looking.

  You will not regret buying these!Bought the Khaki in my regular size 7 and they fit perfect!Had no clue that Crocs updated their shoes. There’s litto nubs on the inside of the sole that feel really nice. The bottom outside sole is also pretty slip proof.Can’t wait to rock my Crocs! It’s cole rn but they are comfy for house slippers or going out to run errands in as long as it’s not raining. It’s cold rn so I may pair with fun socks and leggings for a casual look but they def look better with shorts.Looking forward to getting more colors!!

Crocs Classis Clogs are the best for summer
",JLee,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I love the class Crocs clog.  My feet swell in hot, humid weather, and these are the only shoes I can tolerate.  I also walk several miles a day to and from work, and these are the best.I buy wear a size six-and-a-half, and I order the Crocs in size seven to give my feet room to swell.  In cooler weather, I wear socks; hot weather, no socks.  Also, putting the strap on the back of my heel holds them on when my feet aren’t swelling.  When they swell, I push the strap up to the top of the shoe.They provide excellent arch support.  I have very high arches and a very high instep and I am very comfortable in these shoes.The main drawback is that if it is raining and you walk into a store with smooth floors, swoosh, slip, slide.  You have to be very careful.  Usually, there is a mat to wipe your shoes at the entrance.  Use it.Also, I have a friend with MS who tells me these shoes do not provide enough lateral support, so if you are unfortunate enough to share that need, these shoes are not sufficient.  For everyone else, they are terrific, very, very comfortable.You can wash your Crocs, best to use a damp cloth, but you can put them in the sink if they get filthy.  Most of the time, an occasional swipe along the inside with damp cloth or paper towel is all you need to prevent them picking up odors.  If they start to squeak, put some vegetable oil on them overnight and then wipe them off in the morning with a paper towel.If they are too big, put them in the dryer with a damp towel for a few minutes.  If they are too small, do the same, but take them out and put them on and walk around in them to stretch them.

Misleading Images
",Will,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I ordered the 'Pepper' colored classic clog. The pepper color that was advertised in the images was this blueish blackish shade croc sort of like the navy color that is advertised but a shade lighter. The actual pepper clog is a bright red croc, but not necessarily neon red its kind of like the color of a pepper. I'm not really upset with the actual croc but more so that I didn't get the product that was advertised by the images. So I guess buyer beware and look up the colors on google images beforehand to make sure that you're getting the color you actually want. I'll add more to this review if there are any further issues down the line.

  If you are in the reviews you have come to terms with looks. So are they comfortable you might ask, OF COURSE THEY ARE!

A feather lite cloud of fairies gently stimulating your feet, bringing comfort and relaxation with their sweet embrace. While a wide toe box gives ample room to stretch your sweet little piggies.Wish I had done this years ago, but alas vanity got the better of me. So get over yourself and get into these clogs baby!

For my daughter

  I bought for my daughter because she works retail and they stand all day. The first time she wore them to work, she texted me and said her feet was comfy. I was so happy because my child is so picky and particular on everything.  She wears a 8 and that's what I bought and she said they didn't really slip off... So I think that means because she was wearing socks, she didn't feel the slipping and she said she changed from sports mode back to non-sport throughout the day. She said she mostly wore sports mode because she walks alot on her job.

  If you ever have to go up a half size (especially for sandals, or fear that the back of your heel will hang), just order the next size up. I am glad that I did, as these fit my feet perfectly, with little to no room once I push my feet all the way in the shoe. I would imagine that had I ordered a size down, these would have been a horrible fit. (Normally can order down on tennis shoes and they fit fine).These were a little wide, but  I sometimes feel that's how CROCS made them to either feel/fit. I think they are the perfect outdoor shoe for rainy weather. The Lavender was an excellent color choice. I would highly recommend these shoes to anyone.

  I bought these because the reviews said it helped people with their plantar fasciitis pain and I was suffering a lot every day. My daughter had raved about hers. It took me about 2 weeks to decide if they were helping. When I woke up one day and had no pain at all I realized they had worked all along but it took my body awhile to feel the effects. I think it took awhile to get used to the feeling of this type of shoe also. So far I am loving them. I also noticed that all of the cracks I had around my heels and the ball of my feet are now gone. They are completely healed in just a few weeks that I have been wearing these. I have used so many lotions etc with no success and wearing these shoes for just this short time took them away. I don’t understand how but that is an amazing bonus. for anyone that has experienced painful, cracked skin on your feet you will appreciate these. Wow is all I can say!!

  I destroyed my ankle 3 years ago and have been living in chronic pain ever since. I've tried everything known to man. Even those super expensive shoes where they scan your foot. And yet still, pain. Working on my feet for 12+ hours a day didn't help. I came home every night a cripple. There have been days I have crawled from my car to my door. I've worn crocs every day for a solid week and it has been the first week since my accident that I have been almost pain free. I wear these suckers hard. Working 12+ hours in a hospital, on a concrete floor, running around like a chicken with its head cut off- AND THE CROCS MADE IT.

  Crocs are not going to get you noticed by the opposite sex, but they are comfortable and they last forever. Whether you are going to the grocery store, the garden, or the pool, you can't go wrong in Crocs. My kids are even asking for Crocs now, so I guess they are cool again. So, no worries if you buy them and they are not cool....just wait a while and they will come back in style. If they get dirty, hose them down.

  You either love or hate these types of shoes. I'm a fan of them, and they're especially useful for quick visits outside or around the pool. They're quality, and you can expect them to hold up over time as long as you're not overexerting them.

Comfort at the cost of style.
",Jared Davis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Honestly, I never thought in a million years I would wear Crocs, let alone actually enjoy wearing them. They are actually a daily driver in my shoe repertoire. I pretty much only wear them around the house but for a house shoe, they are just too comfortable to give up. It's been around 9 months since I got them and they are holding up amazingly well. I still wear them around the house daily. One con I can give them is that you HAVE to wash them at least weekly otherwise they will absolutely reek. I'm not sure what causes it since my other shoes don't smell at all but these get ripe really easily.The shoe, in general, is bigger than what the packaging says just because they make the width a little bigger so make sure to measure your foot (there are guides out there to figure out your croc size) before you buy.

  Crocs are dorky but keep your feet cool, great on wet days, very comfortable, easy to get on and off and last.Although I swore I wasn't going to buy shoes on the internet due to the hassle of getting a good fit, I did it again. Even with free returns a one hour shoe buying trip can take weeks to get the size right online due to the shipping back and forth. Why did I do it? Crocs closed all of their retail stores near us. I tried looking in the larger retailers that Croc says carry their shoes and found that they didn't!These were to replace an identical pair I've owned for 6 years. The tread was gone so it as time. I checked the reviews and the Amazon shoe sizer and decided to go 1 size smaller than my old pair which were comfortable but a little large. Not knowing whether Crocs had changed/improved the last for their shoe after a few years even getting the same model can be a guess on size.

I couldn't kick them off of my feet as hard as I swam, and they did a great job protecting my whole foot in the river. Highly recommend!

Love these stress-relieving Crocs
",Lyr Lobo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I'm on my fourth pair in this style and love these Crocs. I wear them every day around the house. Three pairs I bought  a size larger and I feel like I'm not wearing shoes.  The fourth looks more dainty for travel. The inner sole features textured nubs that massage my feet. They feel fantastic, last 1-2 years of daily wear, and are easy to clean!

Wore out my old pair, new pair is stiff because they need to be broken in
",JeriOwl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  The longer I wear each pair of Crocs the more comfortable they become.  I've worn many different styles and colors of Crocs, the khaki classic clog is my timeless favorite for most every season but bitterly cold.  They are ideal for every day wear around the home or town, at the pool or even for basic farm chores. Fit is always true to size but be forewarned, black tends to shrink in sunlight whereas I've never encountered this problem with other colors.

PERFECT HOUSE SHOES
",r0chelle67,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  The perfect upgrade to my crummy old house slippers! I have gone through several pairs of “memory foam” house slippers... they never last me more than a few months before they go flat and become practically useless... no support, get dirty fast, and then they don’t wash well. These were the perfect solution. SO comfortable, easy to slip on with or without socks, easy to clean, and they actually keep my feet a bit warm! LOVE them and I get sad to take them off when I need to leave the house. I’m between a 7.5-8, average width, and the 8 fits great.

I wanted to find these classic ones because I loved to wear them around the house as indoor slippers
",Ryan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I couldn't find the classic ones in the stores around where I live anymore. They all have adopted the newer hard bottoms. I wanted to find these classic ones because I loved to wear them around the house as indoor slippers. Just for some context, I'm Asian, and we don't wear shoes into the house. Partially to keep the floors clean, but probably some other cultural reason that I haven't looked into yet. We have specific indoor slippers. I haven't looked too much into slippers, but I know these are good in the winter time because they can keep my feet warm and are easy to wash if they start to smell.The only problem I have with these are that it's hard to know what size to buy without trying them on, but that's just me.

  I have a very old pair of Crocs that are the MOST COMFORTABLE shoe ever. In this time of Covid I wear them a lot. In fact I wear them most of the time. They were wearing out and I decided to order another pair. This new pair is fine really but nothing like the just soft enough, just firm enough old pair that I still have. I slip my feet into that old pair and my feet stop barking and start purring. They are a treasure. If my life was a nation they would be a National Treasure.So I was very sad that these new ones were not exactly like my old ones. If you didn't have my old ones to compare to you might not know what you were missing. I did not post a review at the time of purchase as I was too busy worrying about Covid and life and survival.

  I have held an anti-Croc position with much color and fanfare, for years now. Making fun of them and the wearer whenever I could. Then I finally got a pair two weeks ago. And not just any pair, bright yellow. If I'm gonna hate on Croc's why not do it loudly. I just so happened to be on vacation last week, which required 10+ miles of walking per day. I wore them like my life depended on it. And alas, I find myself begrudgingly a fan. They are really well designed, so simple, but so effective. Everywhere slippers, and when I say everywhere, that includes lobster boats, scaling the rough coastline of Maine, walking endless long dirt roads, outdoor showers on the beach.

That said, how hard is it to take them off? They do what they are supposed to.A word to the wise: Do not leave your Crocs out in the sun. They will shrink.

Don’t worry, it’ll be worth it.

Comfortable for house shoes
",BookLover,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I wear these around the house b/c I have high arches and am not supposed to go barefoot very much. They don't have much arch support, so I added felt arch cookies and now they provide better support. They're a little loose but I like that, since I'm using them as house slippers.

Great fit, very comfortable
",D. Yauch,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I normally wear size 8.5. Usually when I get footware such as this they only come in whole sizes, so I have to choose between 8 and 9 (US). My experience has told me to go with the 8 (flip flops, muck boots, etc). It held true for these, I ordered the size 8 and fit is just what I wanted. Overall love the design, there is a bit of arch support which I want, very comfortable. I wear these as ""house slippers"" all the time I'm in the house, I live on a farm and wear boots most of the time outside, so out in the garage I leave these while stepping into my boots, and vice versa. I probably wouldn't wear these out anywhere, but you certainly could. I don't use the straps, just leave them in the out of the way position, forward, but if I did wear them any place but in the house I'd probably engage those straps.

Best Shoes Ever
",Taylor Becker,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I had a pair of Crocs as a kid, but never got another pair once I grew out of them. Like so many, I fell into the ""Crocs are the worst"" mindset (where it's fashionable to hate them). Having a two year old, I was looking for a pair of slip on shoes that were more comfortable than flip flops. After hours of searching, I remembered my childhood Crocs and decided to give them a chance and I'm SO glad I did. I don't even care that they look a little silly (but really not bad!) because they're so stinkin comfortable. Now I can slip them on to play outside with my daughter, run to the store, or play in the lake. They're awesome!

Lightweight easycare slip ons
",Sue Woods,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I work as a volunteer with puppies, with a hygiene routine that requires me to change footwear inside and outside their pens. These are perfect for the job, being (very) lightweight, easy to disinfect and slip on and off. The back strap is useful to give added security if needed. I am an 8 1/2 (US), 39 Eur or 6.5 UK and I bought a size 9. They are easy to wear and keep on, particularly with socks, and I'm not swimming in them, as I had feared I might be.

  If your favorite color is green then you will love this shoe and even if it’s not you will still love it ! The green is much prettier in person. It’s like a jade/emerald green.

Great for gardening & around the house
",jellybean,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have worn these since I got my first pair for 50¢ at a garage sale! The price on Amazon was not quite that good, but it was on the low side. I did have to return mine though because my size was not available in my desired color of khaki. Zappos had them (free shipping and free returns). As always, Amazon is my first choice, but even having to pay $6 more on Zappos.com I got the color I needed. Crocs sizing can be confusing: the bottom of each shoe list two sizes:  M (men) W (women). So when looking for your size, look for your gender size. The shoes should fit roomy at the toe and at the heal - do not let them rub anywhere (as advised by crocs). You will get used to the loose fit after a while - or just use the back strap for more stability. I ordered M 8/ W6 and it was to small (short: toe & heal touched ends) My normal shoe size is women's 8 and on rare occasion 8 1/2. My foot is narrow to med. width. The size I needed from crocs was M7/W9 (so the women's 8 was too small/short). Amazon showed my size of US7/9 (way down at the bottom of the scroll down drop-list), but did not have my color available. Thought I'd take a chance (to save $6) and try women's 8. Zappos, like Amazon, delivered quickly and the shoes in the proper size 7/9 fit!

  I returned the first pair of Crocs (unisex) that I purchased because they were ginormous. They were not only large but very wide. That said, they felt good on the sole of my arthritic feet. I went on-line again & search for a pair that was described as ""women's"" because other reviewers stated there was a definite difference in the width, ie, women's were narrower. Not so. These are just as wide. I normally wear Danskos so I'm accustomed to a shoe that fits loosely but I feel I could almost get both feet in one Croc.If you have wide feet, order the B(M)--Do NOT size up.

And the covered toe keeps them from catching is things ((which is always *my* problem with flip-flops - the toes catch and I trip)).  The back-strap is optional, but there if one needs it.

  These are the old original Crocs they've been selling for many years now. It was about 4-5years ago when they started making some newer Crocs with a newer type of plastic, I've bought a few pairs of those and they've all had problems with shrinking, which eventually causes them to rub and blister your foot in different places, to be expected when you buy shoes that fit, which then proceed to shrink! Don't know why they sell those ones, the material is clearly defective imo. These originals might wear out a little quicker but they're comfortable and don't shrink.

  I originally purchased these for my girlfriend for Christmas. We use Crocs to go kayaking in since they're rubber and clearly don't hold water. The only downside to using these for something like kayaking is that when the surface you're stepping on is slick, don't expect Crocs to have a firm grip - they'll make you slip easily (only downside but not enough to give 4/5 stars). We also wear crocs to go out in the spring time when the yard is just mud. That way, we can just hose the crocs off and our feet off before we go back in the house.I ordered the size shoe she usually wears and it fits her perfect without any issues.

They are basically all I wear, whether I'm at work, going to a wedding (YES), gardening, at the beach, I mean:  once you go Crocs, you never go back!!!I have a C width foot, which is just a tad wider than what the shoe industry considers ""normal"" (namely a B), yet really it is right in the middle of the width spectrum.  I love that the Crocs Classics are the perfect width for me.  I love how much cushioning is between the sole of your foot and the sidewalk or whatever you are walking on.

These Deserve More Than 5 Stars!
",Ananda,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are the most comfortable shoes you could buy! I read mixed reviews about them and was a little worried about how they would fit considering I stuck to my actual size and didn’t go up/down a size. I’m a size 8w and ordered just that and they fit me perfectly!!! I also read how some people received fake ones but the ones I got are the real deal. I compared them to my friends crocs and lucky me, I received the real ones. As soon as I got them I wore them out to the store and the arch support is perfect for me because I have flat feet and wear arch supporters in my sneakers anyway. The fact they have arch support makes them 10/10!  I definitely see myself ordering more and more!! If you’re thinking about getting these, just do it! You will not regret it I promise you.

  Mostly I wanted to note to others that if left or worn a lot in the sunlight, THESE WILL SHRINK CONSIDERABLY.I first bought 14's,  but at season's end, they were too small for me to wear.I bought these 16's and at the end of this hot Summer, they are just about right for me.One of my feet is a 15, the other a 14.Takes some time for these to shrink, so you'll have to suffer through some floppiness, or wear thick socks until the shrink to fit.

  One of my sons had a neat pair of some inexpensive rubbery shoes and I asked him to get me a pair. Dissatisfied with them I bought myself some Crocs instead.

  My wife has had a pair of crocs for 10 years and I never considered joining her.  I have never liked sandals.  I like flip flips even less.  Crocs looked uncomfortable to me.

Comfort Over Style!
",LDK,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I know this fad is probably already over, but I just decided to finally buy a pair in anticipation of a cruise. I'm not crazy about the texture that you put your feet on (a little spiky), but I got used to it. I am picky about my footwear, and there are few things I can wear without the soles of my feet hurting. These things are SO comfortable! They are super lightweight and seriously the only footwear I needed for the entire week on the cruise. I wore them in the room, walking around the ship, walking around ports, to the beach, to the pool, and even to dinner. The last is maybe not recommended, but you can definitely get away with it. :) I even tried to continue wearing them once I got back to the Minnesota snow (although that did not work out so well). I like the black color because they blend in a little bit more than the brighter colors. They do get crease marks on the top of them, but there's not really a way to prevent that. You might lose a few style points, but they are so comfortable you will not even care!

They finally needed replaced after a small hole got worn into the sole.  They held up very well for a long time.  Probably should have been replaced a year ago but even 4 years of wear and tear is pretty good for rubber shoes.  These new ones fit just like the old ones.

  I’ve been wanting crocs for years and I am a 10 in women’s. 8.5 in men’s. I don’t play with my feet. The crocs 8/10 that I have tried on always seem like it’s a 9.5.  So  i broke down I went with the 9/11 which is a 9/11. Bc it’s too big for me.8/10 is in accurate but I love crocs. I have a pair of wedges which are cute and crazy comfortable

Comfort and Quality
",Patchouli Patty,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  True Croc! The first thing I noticed was that the inside sole is textured with soft bumps that massage the bottom of my feet. They are just so comfortable. And this green is true green. I really wanted to get the tie dyed, but when I read the reviews I was afraid it was just painted on. The green is solid, not painted, like John Deere Green...I love em!

Comfy but runs small
",A. Russell,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Love Crocs sandals. They're super light weight and fairly durable considering they're just made of foam. They're some of the more comfortable sandals I own, since they have some arch support and whatnot in them. I still couldn't wear them for a whole day, or even several hours at once, but for brief periods, like to run outside or wear at the beach, they're great. I only have 1 complaint, they tend to run about 2 sizes too small. I wear a 9- 9.5 regularly, but had to order a 12 in Crocs so they'd fit comfortably.

  I usually wear a womens 8.5 in regular shoes but after reading reviews sized down to an 8. The 8 fits perfectly without looking too big or clownish. While my co-workers mock my clown shoes, they are the only thing saving my feet from burning after 8 hour shifts of standing and running around. Would recommend to anyone who has to stay on their feet a lot or simply wants comfortable shoes! :) They do feel better if you wear thicker socks.

  The Croslite Polymer rubber-like material is extremely soothing to your feet. I use these as slippers indoors. They keep your feet cool in the summer and warm in the winter. As soon as I walk in the door, I step into these. These shoes RELAX your feet big time! You can wear the strap in the front or the back. I wear it in the back to secure my heel. You can also use them at the beach to protect your feet from glass, rocks, & sea weed. These Crocs are the first item I put in my suitcase no matter where I'm going. You can throw them in the washing machine and they quickly air dry. You can also hose them off. They are my 2nd feet! I wear them all the time I am inside my house (except when I'm sleeping) because they feel so comfortable. These Crocs last for years! The value greatly exceeds the price and you will save hundreds of dollars on slippers if you use them in their place. I highly recommend them!

CROCS !!! Is the hype true ?!?!
",KING OF NEW YORK HACKS,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Fits well, first time Crocs owner so will try to do an update in a month or so after they are broken in. After reading the reviews I was hoping for American made but got ""Made in Vietnam"". Other sites said that's a good thing, we shall see. So far they fit perfect, a little room for the big toe and both my feet are surprisingly comfortable being they just came out of the bag. Feels like a slipper and the motion of my feet react just like they do with slides, however when I pull the Crocs strap back, both feet are snug and grip the ground firmly much more than I anticipated. Will test on wet floors, beach, hot tar, and concrete. Any other tests anyone wants done let me know and maybe I'll experiment with them. I'll do an update review in a month or sooner if they wind up being my summer go to shoe. Giving 5 starts because so far everything promised was given from quick delivery to a proper fit. Will change if things don't work out, but for now Crocs is living up to the hype.

  Thoroughly impressed with these. I didn't have a strong opinion of these before I purchased (most people think ugly). I was looking for something to wear anywhere and everywhere, which these are fantastic for.

Also worth mentioning, I suffer from Lupus and wake up in the morning stiff as a board. These make my mornings so much easier not having to bend down and fuss with putting shoes/slippers on.

Better Than Expected
",Donald Gillette,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I was hesitant to buy these for a couple of reasons.  First, they're...you know--rubber? Plastic? Something like that...  Second, they're...you know--not masculine? Kind of sissified? Finally, the picture makes them look flimsy. So okay. Yes--they are some kind of man-made rubber/plastic/neoprene/something, but that makes them waterproof meaning you can leave them out on the deck after you've been working in the yard and you don't have to worry about them getting soggy and ruined. No--they're not the most masculine shoes I've ever seen, so you have to be pretty confident in your manhood if you wear them out on the town but I got them for yard work which is a fairly macho enterprise. And no, they're not as flimsy as the pictures look. I don't know how long that heel-strap thing will last, but I don't use it half the time anyway and for some reason, your feet don't slip out of the shoes without it, so if it does break--Super Glue and duct tape. THEN they'll look masculine!

  I used to have heel pain --  plantar fascia.  I stretched a couple times a day and that mostly kept the pain at bay.  Then a friend suggested crocs.  Pain gone.  It has been 10 years since I have worn anything else -- or stretched.  I used to these shoes direct from Crocs.  The website is nice and there are all kinds of options.  Almost all of the styles that I tried were narrower.  My 'real shoe' size is 11 EEE.  Crocs Mens 12 work in this style.  If they feel a little tight at first, keep wearing them.  They stretch and, like fine leather shoes, mold to the feet.  Amazon Prime means free shipping, so I can buy one pair at a time without paying shipping and for the same price as the Crocs website or the local box store.And if you take a worn out pair and slice them up, they make fine sanding blocks.

Ugly, but comfy

  For the longest time, ever since they came out really, I thought Crocs were the ugliest shoes. I couldn't see why anybody wore them. However, my boyfriend owns a pair, and I had to wear them a few times (granted his feet are quite bigger than mine). They. Are. Comfortable. As. Heck. It took a while, but I finally decided that I needed to buy a pair of my own. My feet hurt all the time, especially my heels because that's where I put all of my weight when standing. Let me tell you: I can walk around for hours wearing these shoes, and I don't feel any discomfort. Even after a 9-hour shift of standing and walking around at work, I can put these on, and my feet already feel better. Do yourself a favor and buy yourself a pair. I wear 8 1/2, so I dropped down a half size as recommended, and they fit perfectly.

  At first I had an issue with actually getting my item which worried me a little bit because it was supposed to be here and then it wasn’t but they ended up sending me another pair so that was wonderful.

  I love these clogs!!! I still have my old pair since 2004! I bought a new pair just in case my old pair might fail.I was reading some of the reviews here stating that the clog is a tight fit. It's only tight because it hasn't been worn and it's brand new. Once you keep wearing it, it'll loosen over time.

Can't live without them!
",Beloved,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I had a pair of these that I had worn almost every day for 6+ years that somehow got lost during a hospital stay.  I was so sad ... and immobilized, as these shoes are what I wear around my house every day while I chase my kiddos and do chores!  If I don't wear them my feet hurt so badly.  After a week or so of going barefoot and not wearing them I ended up with a full limp and a sore knee (from walking funny because of my foot pain).  My husband couldn't stand it anymore and told me to order another pair PRONTO!  I did, and within a day my feet felt great again!  I have incredibly high arches, and these are one of the few types of shoes I can wear for extended periods of time without any pain.  I loooove my crocs!!

4x4 Capable - Comfortable Design
",Mike O. ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Very comfortable footwear that is perfect to have by the back door of you go in and out of the house frequently. They feel good on the bottom of your feet because of the bumpy pattern of the shoe that contacts your sole. They stay on great, and if you need more security you can flip over the strap and put them in four wheel drive mode. I typically wear a 13, or sometimes a 12 1/2 of a shoe manufacturer even makes it, but in these I wear a 12. If your feet sweat, you might find they sweat more in these. However, my feet seem to be getting use to them and seem to be sweating less the more that I wear them. They are a great product, designed well, and seem robust enough to last for years. I would definitely recommend.

  Brought these to slip on if I need to run errands quick and for the summer to wear when I go on a boat or to the beach. These are perfect for all of those things. You won’t be disappointed. Even though I would have liked if these came in half sizes due to the fact that when you put the strap on in the back, your foot is pushed literally to the top of the shoe which to me isn’t uncomfortable, but I know for some individuals it may be. I also like a little bit of a looser fit. But other than that, I couldn’t be happier with this buy!

Happy Convert
",Anne Mills,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Finally gave in, and I love them -- I have resisted crocs for many years, because they look, to be brutal, stupid.  But we spend the winter on the beach, and I got tired of ruining at least two pairs of white sandals a year by getting them wet when I was totally sure I wouldn't.  So: crocs.  The reviews left me frightened of mis-sizing, so I shot an arrow in the air and ordered an eight, which fits perfectly.  They are comfortable on the beach, comfortable around the house, and comfortable when we go out on errands.  Mine are white, and they have stayed dazzlingly clean looking.  On the downside, they do accumulate debris, and the do look -- stupid.  But noone is asking me to wear them on Madison Avenue, and for a beach community, they are just great.

  I ordered this pair of crocs for my 80 year older father as a safer and more supportive option to slippers for those days that his feet are swollen.My father's legs and feet swell, so he tends to wear open back slippers because of the ease of putting them on when his feet swell, however, there is no support and they are a fall risk since they can easily fall off his feet.  The crocs on the other hand are a roomy, solid option for when his feet swell and the air holes help to keep his feet cool, unlike shoes. The back strap keeps them on his feet, thus keeping him safer.

  These are of course super comfortable but beware the strap (see picture) makes them about a size smaller than my normal croc size. For some reason with the white crocs the strap comes in almost a whole inch from the back of the shoe. So if you rock socks and crocs and/or like the strap down to lock in the shoe, your toe will rub in the front if you get your normal size. Which I found uncomfortable. Thankfully Amazon has great returns and I was able to get the best fitting size. Normal size men’s 11 I went up to men’s 12 and fit great.

Size 8 US Men - Good fit on a slightly wide foot
",JK in CA,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have a slightly wide foot, size 8 men's, and they fit comfortably in the size 8 US Men's Classic Clog (the standard size, not wider model). It's roomy, but not to the point where my foot flops around feels insecure, and there's enough room to wear the clogs with socks on. I like that they're easy to slip on and off and have good traction on wet surfaces. So now I just have to see how they'll do over time. They're replacing a pair of sandals that I bought in Hawaii thirty years ago and are still wearable, but I like the fact that the Crocs have a little more toe protection.

Crocs for a win
",Cedrie,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I spend 40 hours a week on my feet on concrete floors. And I walk a lot. I have a very difficult time finding shoes that I don't ache to take off before a couple hours have past. I have wide feet, tall feet, and have a heel lift I wear in my left shoe (which creates its own shoe criteria). I need slip resistant ventilated shoes. These classic crocs fit the bill. I will always be wearing these with socks. They are wide enough for my feet, tall enough for my instep (even with the heel lift) and are quite comfortable to wear all shift. These are not fashion shoes and I don't expect them to be that, but for all the rest of the times, these will be the shoes I wear. My only caution would be that these shoes have little cushion. The rubber does have some give but it is not the same as a well padded shoe. For me this is acceptable because they don't hurt my feet to wear. Other's may find that to be a turn off.

These classic style black Crocs are the same size as purple classics I've had for years but these fit the way shoes should - I didn't realize how loose and big the older pair were.

  These are great to slip into/out of for quick trips to the mailbox or garden. The fit is good except I can feel one of my toes hitting the clog on my left foot, so I probably wouldn't wear them for long walks. I think this is because of my feet and not the shoes. Overall, just what I wanted.

She loves their fit and how comfortable they are
",Patti Wismer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  My daughter suddenly has a Croc obsession.  She has about 7 pairs, all different colors.  She loves their fit and how comfortable they are.  She has been wearing them to school (high school) and seems to be starting a trend.  She also wears them to the softball field and in between games. (Camo is her field color)  She referred her friends to Amazon as the shipping is free AND they have a great variety AND they are cheaper than at the outlets.  I think I will even be getting a pair or 2 for Christmas...  :)  BUT WE CANNOT FIND PURPLE FOR A LOWER PRICE!  That is her high school color...  They aren't as cheap as the other colors for some reason.  :(But we still love Crocs!!

Absolutely amazing

  The best thing on this earth for anyone’s feet!! Bought a pair for myself and my boyfriend. He absolutely hate the style, and so do I. But I cannot deny how freaking comfortable they are!!! I have trouble finding good comfortable sneakers because I have semi wide feet. But these are absolutely amazing and comfy. Great for the entire family!! Also the material is so nice, it will not allow your foot to slide out of the shoes at all. And cleaning then is super easy. No complaints.

  I've been aware of these since they came on the market but have never been motivated to try a pair, what a mistake.They are the do-all shoe. They are shower shoes, gardening shoes, mow the lawn shoes, kick around the house shoes. If they get dirty just hose 'em off and you're good to go again. They have great grippers on the bottom and don't slip on a wet patio like flip-flops do. Why oh why did I wait so long, better late than never!

Convienent shoes
",Allison,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  The ideal user for this product is any person boy or girl who is looking for a comfortable, durable, and water resistant shoe. These shoes are perfect slide on shoes for any quick, pick up situation. Whether that be running errands, taking the dog out, or anything else. These shoes are made for all ages, come in a variety of colors and are made for both sexes.These shoes are very durable and water resistant. I bought a pair of white ones in august of 2017, and they still look brand new (and I wear them way too often.) They clean up very easily and are perfect if the ground outside is wet or muddy. They have holes along the side and on the top which allows your feet to breathe. An amazing quality about these shoes is that they are wide enough so you have enough space in the shoe to wear a sock!These shoes have many positive characteristics about them. I would say the most positive aspect of them is that they are very convenient, and can be worn in any situation. But other positive aspects of these shoes are that they are comfortable, breathable, easy to clean, water resistant, come in all colors, and the list is endless!Most people are hesitant in purchasing these shoes because of the way they look, but since 2016 crocs have become popular again. If a shoe like these are this comfy no one should care about what they look like! I have had a very positive experience with my crocs and I would recommend any to purchase these, because they are worth the money. I am all about convenience and these shoes are my go to whenever I’m about to run out and need to slide something on quick.These shoes are made for everyone and not only are they convenient for an adult to wear, they are perfect shoes for children to wear as well. They can get them dirty and run around outside and the can be cleaned off fast, while not being ruined. They also sell gibbets for these shoes, making them personable and a fun attraction for children.Overall I would give these shoes overall a very positive review because I have gotten a lot of use out of mine. They are worth every penny and a great investment. They last a long time and are great shoes to own.

The best house shoes ever made
",Toospendie,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  This is my third pair of Crocs clogs. I personally think they're ugly and I can't figure out how they ever became fashionable but so it goes. The thing is, I have fallen arches (pes planus) and I my feet kill (I used the word ""kill"" to describe pain) me sometimes! These are far and away the most comfortable things I can put on my feet. They're light as air and they kind of form-fit to my arches. It's like getting a mini-massage just by walking around. I wear them whenever I'm lounging around the house or doing chores but I don't wear them outside at all. Something else to note: They don't stink. At least not for a long time. I think that's pretty remarkable. When they do start to smell, I couldn't really figure out an effective way to clean them so I just threw them away and bought new ones (they also lose their form a little after a year or so). I figure I can afford a pair every year or so so that I can have happier feet.

New Convert to Crocs <3
",GK,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have resisted these shoes for years! Finally tired of ruining my regular shoes by wearing them in the garden or accidentally stepping in something I should have picked up earlier, I have finally found a shoe that I can wear and wash--and is TRULY COMFORTABLE AND LIGHT. You don't really think about how light shoes are until you put Crocs on. In fact, I liked them so much I bought a second pair to wear out and about. I never thought it would happen but I am truly a Crocs lover now!To be fair, I don't love the way they look, and my feet sometimes get cold so I bought socks. (Yes, I went there!) But I have gotten to a point in my life that function beats form and I am the happier for it.

  Crocs are ugly. We all know it. Nobody buys crocs to be a fashion icon (I hope). This aside, they're a good utilitarian shoe. My husband has to wear close-toed shoes to his work, and tennis shoes were killing his feet (they're big and not made to fit inside confining shoes ha).He has to wear socks with them (really highlighting his stellar sense of fashion) because apparently the holes on top pull the hair out of the top of his feet. Go figure. However other than that, he says they're comfortable and provide good support.I was also pleased that these shoes come in boat size, as not all brands carry for large-footed people.

  I usually wear a size 10D, and ordered these in size 10D.  If I wore these with socks, they'd be a perfect fit.  In bare feet, they're just a little loose (surprise surprise).  I wish they'd been available in my size in another color.  My only option was Khaki, which looks like rice-fed doggy poop.  But I don't wear 'em to look at them.  I wear them because they feel great.  And for the price (under $20, delivered by amazon Prime, go amazon!) I can't complain.  They're great clomp around clogs, keep your feet warm wet or dry, kick out irritants through the many open holes, and are very comfortable on my feet.  I have yet to use the heel strap or take them for a significant walk, but that's not why I bought them.  I wanted super easy on and off, comfortable enough to run errands in, and secure enough on my feet that I didn't have to think about where I put my feet when walking in them.  They fit the bill quite nicely, thank you very much.

Today, I have a pair of originals for warm-weather outdoor use, and another no-holes, fuzzy-lined pair for cold-weather outdoor use.  These are replacements for a worn-out indoor-only pair.

For example a Men's size 10 is a Woman's size 12. I wear a size 10 in a sneaker so a size 10 in a Croc was plenty big enough as they fit slightly larger. I wear them as a clog with the strap folded to the front. Great for a slip-on to run to the mailbox. I will get another pair.

They can also be worn in ""relaxed mode"" with the thingy on top of your foot for lazy Sundays and doing chores.

Great if you have sweaty feet.
",Vinh ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have sweaty feet so rubber sandals are literally the only type of sandals I can wear. Any other sandals I wear I have to wash otherwise it’ll stink. I don’t have to wash these rubber sandals because they don’t stink and don’t absorb my sweat. These are well made and are really durable, but I don’t recommend running in them. They can still rip if you run in them. I had this experience before as it is why I bought a new one from this seller.

and always like them. However
",a customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I got this particular pair for my son, and he likes to wear it. He is size 6.5 or 7, and he wears the shoes with the strap up, so they fit him very well. He outgrown several pairs of crocs over the years, and always like them.However, if you wanted to wear the strap behind your heel as pictured, buy a size up - the strap is shorter then needed, I wear Woman's size 9 so should fit in this shoes well, but with the strap down, my toes painfully push into the front of the shoe, and I cannot wear them. The problem is consistent - I have several years old pair of the same crocs in another color, and it is the same - fine with the strap up, but I cannot wear it with strap down.The shoes are very lightweight.

  I love crocs! They are so comfortable! This is my first time buying a pair of crocs on amazon and the shoes fit me well but I noticed that one size is wider than the other pair and that disappointed me a lot! Not sure if that’s how crocs are supposed to be made but please AMAZON, check on the shoes carefully! And to answer why I didn’t return it was because I wore it the first day it was delivered to me and didn’t really paid much attention to it till the next day and it was kinda dirty already. I also just ordered another pair after realizing the other pair was wider than the other so I hope it’s not the same problem as my first one.

Best comfortable fitting shoe
",Dave Musil,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I love these and wear them a lot. They have the typical Croc roomy fit which feels almost like you're barefoot.  You think that they would come off your foot when you walk but they don't.  They feel sort of gel-like on your feet with their cushiony rubber. I really like the option of using the heel strap or flipping it up so you can slip in and out of them easily, like slippers.  You get used to their quirky appearance, if not, get one of the more traditional looking models. I have three different styles which I wear exclusively as casual shoes.

  I like these shoes, got these for myself and a black pair for my husband. For both of us they are a bit large so I would say go down about half a size. We like wearing them after a shower at the gym (where flip flops for the shower) to air out or feet. Sometimes we where them at home however, they attract dog hair like nobody's business. There are people who have videos and instructions on how to remove pet hair from your carpet with these things. So on carpet and wood floor they are great for them but that is not my purpose.They feel great so I will keep wearing them.

  My first Crocs! I have never worn Crocs because I thought they were the ugliest shoes ever. I still think that, lol.But...I needed shoes I could garden in, shoes that I could clean by washing in the sink when I finished my gardening chores. You can't do that with any other shoe. They're so cheap. And so squishy comfortable.The fit is spot on for me. I wear size nine in most shoes and the Croc 9 is perfect in length. The toe box is super tall and wide, but this doesn't affect comfort or size.Good heavens they're ugly though.

Great Fit & Design! Very Satisfied!
",cjl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I am so happy to find a cute pair of Crocs that will go with my jeans and any top I might wear with them. What I am most excited about, is these crocs fit my feet very well. In the last year or two I've had problems with the new sizing for Crocs (purchased directly) and have had to return or giveaway or not wear four pairs. So I took a chance on ordering  this pair  and I was thrilled that they fit and they look really cute. I normally wear a size woman's nine which is what I ordered.  I am so pleased that I am going to order another pair just like them so I expect to be set for a number of years! One additional note, I have diabetic nerve damage and Crocs are the most comfortable shoes for my feet, in addition they keep my feet protected and provide additional stability for walking.  I couldn't be more pleased to have found this new design and one that fits so perfectly.

  Needed presentable replacement for very old dark blue, paint-splattered Crocs. The last in new pair, or whatever you call it, is same as in old pair. I’ve bought other Crocs (different clog styles) over the years and they’ve all been made with different lasts —as a result, I have a collection of Crocs that don’t be fit very well. So I’ve just gone back to the original...

Great shoes but not left/right consistent
",M. Rodriguez,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  The curve of the Croc at the instep strap connection was narrower than the right Croc, which results in slight rubbing against my left foot where there's clearance on the right foot. Not a huge deal since I am using these as house shoes and mostly with socks. I would have returned them if I were using as outdoor errand shoes.

I love my Crocs !!!
",Melinda in Texas,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I knew what size to order because I bought a pair locally, so the ones from amazon fit perfectly. My old ones looked too shabby to wear away from home. I wish you had BEIGE/TAN in my size...UPDATE APRIL 13, 2014:  I just read comments about ""made in Mexico"" and ""made in China"" ... interesting. My regular shoe size is 10.5, but the Crocs I bought recently and fit me perfectly are 'women's size 9'.  I just looked at the local-store-Croc and the amazon-crocs -- both were made in Mexico -- I guess 'that's a good thing.'  I looked at my very old & shabby Crocs and they say ""BOULDER,COLORADO"" and ""[...]."" I don't know what this means....

Best thing since sliced bread!
",J. Ramsey,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I love my crocs! I wear them everywhere on dry days and even in the shower. I bought one pair in yellow and they were so comfortable I bought another in brown to wear out. The brown ones were different sizing than the yellow ones since the yellow beach ones were size 8-9 and the brown ones size Women's 8M. Both fit fine but the brown ones fit best with thin socks if I wear socks.I have diabetes and liver cirrhosis, both of which cause problems with legs and feet, so I need shoes that are very comfortable and not too tight. Crocs really are perfect. I thought the little bumps in the bottom inside would bother me in bare feet but they don't. They are roomy enough that if my feet swell a bit they still fit. They sort of stick to the soles of my feet (even with socks) so there's no rubbing against my sensitive skin.They are also great in the shower. I don't have to worry about slipping, especially when I use hair conditioner or body wash that is slippery, and I can wash my crocs at the same time I wash me. Fantastic!

All-Terrain Slippers
",Danny F.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I originally bought these so that I didn't have to put on socks and shoes just to check the mail (rocky driveway). I had no idea that I would love them as much as I do.Pros:- incredibly comfortable, I could wear them all day- my feet are wide, and they still fit perfectly- there is almost nothing you can do to mess them up, just wash the rubberCons:- when using the heel strap, it is very difficult for me to remove the shoes. I know that this is a feature, as that is the literal purpose of the strap, but sometimes it feels like a bug.These are the most versatile slip-on shoes I've ever owned.

  These clogs are homely, but suit my big even more homely feet just fine. Great for schlupping around the house, etc., w/o having to don socks & shoes.

For Ease & Comfort
",Paperden,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  It's about the ease of donning & doffing and general comfort. It's not about any aesthetic appeal, which it is perhaps not particularly high on. I found my first pair (of the original Crocs--new in box) while dumpster diving several years ago. I brought them home to show my wife just how absurd a pair of shoes can look. For a lark, I tried them on and--what do you know? Those goofy-looking shoes were extremely comfortable! I have worn them near daily ever since. Interestingly, after they started getting popular and appearing on lots of other people's feet, they stopped looking quite so goofy.As much as I like them, they are problematic for some occasions. Little rocks and dirt sometimes get in through the holes; when the soles get worn smooth from use they are extremely slippery on wet sidewalks; goathead stickers and glass can easily pierce through the soft sole and into your previously happy foot; Bare feet can sweat in the summer and slide around a bit; I wear them so much that I get tan spots through the holes, leaving my feet polka-dotted when I remove my shoes.Overall though, for the reasons of ease and comfort, I love 'em.

4.5 Stars!
",VeronicaB.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I will give these 5 stars bc they are amazing, but I want give 4.5 bc they do run small BUT ONLY BC the band makes it that way. I've always been a women's 9 in the classic fit, but I guess feet grow. I ordered a 9 and the band makes them too small, should have ordered up one size. If you wear them without the heel band than the fit is no issue.Updated a few minutes later: I actually tried on my 6 year old 9 size pair, and they fit perfectly, band or no band. Hmmm.

Very comfortable shoe!
",Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Crocs are great for those of us with foot issues.  They aren’t the prettiest but when your feet hurt you don’t care about fashion. I have owned many pairs of crocs. This style isn’t my favorite (the Mary Jane style is my favorite) but they serve the purpose. I am on my feet all day. In this style I should have ordered an 8 to have room for thick socks. I am keeping them and will wear thin socks. In the Mary Jane style a 7 is fine. I normally wear a 7-71/2. I recommend them if you are looking for comfort.

  I have had a pair of Crocs that have lasted MANY years.  These were purchased as a replacement.

Great functional and comfortable shoe for work
",aeniman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  No matter the stigma about Crocs, they don’t make a more comfortable shoe. As a big man with size 13-14 shoes depending on the brand, these have been great for work. I spend 13 hours, most of them on my feet, as a nurse, and have yet to come home with my “dogs barking” since wearing these. Yes, I’ve gotten a couple jokes about my styling, but I always counter with how comfortable and functional they are. Also, bedside nurses: when you get some body fluids on your Nikes or leather clogs, you probably can’t just hose them off, eh?

  If you don't care about what people think about your fashion sense these are the most comfortable shoes to buy ever. plus when they get dirty you can wear them in the shower or wash them in the sink. as you wear them the rubber will wear down and mold to the shape of your foot which only makes them even more comfortable. a pair will provide about 2-3 years of frequent use before the rubber becomes too thin and you step on a thorn that gets stuck in your foot for about a week.

As expected, and even surprised
",M. K. Johnson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I am not normally a Crocs fan because there is zero arch support, but I needed a pair to accomodate the compression wraps on my feet, which I had to wear for over a month. I ordered up a couple of sizes, thanks to the handy measurement guide provided. They have worked out fabulously, and the price was just right where I was comfortable, considering I won't be wearing them for long. And surprisingly, I've not had any back issues or a flare in my plantar fasciitis, so mabye the arch support is sufficient enough after all. I'm actually considering ordering a pair of the wooly style for the winter!

Crocs cost too much but dang they work!

  My kids mock me for wearing them, but I don't care. My last pair lasted 11 years until I made the mistake of leaving them outside on a hot day in the sun. Public Service Announcement: Crocs SHRINK. So you have to replace them. And they are pretty dang expensive, if you ask me. But as long as you don't let them sunbathe they will probably last forever.

Fit my wide feet and were very comfortable.
",Roxane,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I had always thought Crocs were rather unattractive shoes and didn't understand how and why people would wear them. Then I retired, bought a power washer, and badly needed some outdoor shoes that could handle the water and still give me the traction to push the mower. (I did NOT want to get my nice athletic shoes all wet and green from the grass.) A shoe store associate directed me to the Croc. I knew the Croc was a wider shoe and only came in whole sizes. So I ordered an 8 even though I wear an 8.5. This shoe fit my wide feet perfectly and was very comfortable. I love, love, love that I don't have to worry about getting dirt, water, soap, grass stains, etc. on these shoes because I can just wash them off with the hose. In the meantime, my athletic shoes stay in pristine condition. THEN, I started wearing the Crocs around the house while cleaning and running up and down the stairs doing laundry. I am even considering wearing them when I run to the grocery store or gym!! Another bonus is that these shoes come in a variety of attractive colors,

  This is worth the price - this is my second pair of Crocs, and I've had two other pairs of the ""off"" brands to compair to.  My first pair of Crocs lasted 2 years of wearing them EVERYWHERE!!  The Brand X last 6 months for one pair and 9 months for another.  These are well worth the price.  Now, the comfort.  My first pair took me a bit to get used to the 'nubs' on the bottom...I had to wear socks for the first couple of months but with socks or without socks, they were the most comfortable - I took a trip with a Youth Group Geo-caching in San Francisco and if you've ever been geo-caching, you know that you walk and walk and walk - I must have logged over 6 miles in the 3 hours, up hills and down and my feet felt wonderful.  These are great!

  I've got a high arch, and I've heard croc's are bad for people with high arches but these shoes are incredibly comfortable. Most of the pressure on my feet are the heels and the very end up of my foot, and with these shoes my feet feel great all day. I understand where people are coming from now when they say how comfortable they are. Other than that don't expect a fashion statement these shoes are fugly and are specifically comfort and convenience. (Looks good with scrubs, you might want to buy the crocs with a flat top though since most Hospitals won't let you have shoes with holes in them).

  Softer than all the other crocs are the classic crocs. For someone who is a 9 and a half. The 9 was too small and the 10 just a bit too roomy. Go with the size up you in my opinion. The citrus color is a nice yellow tinted slightly green. So like a light chartreuse.

I also have to order a size UP from what I usually wear (size 8) because of the way the toe box angles towards the pinky toe. I think it might be because my middle toe is longest and my third is the same length as my first. But knowing that I order correctly and have multiple pairs.

They provide relief and my feet are not sore by the end of the day.For sizing, the reviews said they run large. I wear a women's size 9 and these size 9 Crocs fit perfectly.

  If you have classic crocs that you bought 5 years ago you'll find these running smaller than those did. That is, big for shoes, small for crocs. They are a little shorter, a little narrower and especially not as high in the toe box (i.e. lower profile). I wear 8 1/2 wide in standard women's shoes, and 8W, 6M in crocs was always perfect for me before. Now I think I would order a size up next time, even on what Croc bills as a ""roomy"" fit. Apart from fit they are the crocs we know and love (or hate as the case seems to be), nice bouncy feel, easy to clean, durable and perfect for everything but ballroom dancing.

Plantar facia help!
",Jersey Girl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I love the Tropical Teal color of my replacement Crocs - very dramatic. I wear a size 8 and the Crocs size M6/W8 fits perfectly. I can wear with or w/o socks (which I'll wear with my Crocs around the house when the weather gets cold). I have both Achilles' and plantar facia pain and the Crocs give my sore feet a break. They last a long time, too - years.

Great shoe for the beach...
",Jennifer L Eliassen,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have to admit I really find the classic Croc unattractive, but incredibly practical under the right circumstances.  I dislike it for an everyday, all day shoe, but great for the beach or gardening.  Of course, my kids love them.  I have slipped on my son's from time to time (we wear the same size) and they are comfortable to walk in, but slippery if the inside gets wet.  The back strap doesn't really hold the heel the way I think a back strap should.Turns out my son wanted a bright color and was not excited about the khaki color, but he wears a lot of khaki shorts and I think it looks great.  He's 9, so for him bright and bold would be better!  The price I got on Amazon was better than at my local Croc store.

but they're very comfortable and excellent to wear around the house

  I can never say crocs are ""beautiful shoes"", but they're very comfortable and excellent to wear around the house. I buy a pair and wear them for many years until the bottoms are completely worn out. I've never had a complaint about my crocs. I do suffer from plantar fasciitis so I put inserts in them for additional arch support. It would be awesome to see a pair developed that would make the additional insole support unnecessary.

  These have a  cushiony sole and are well made. I got them to wear while I work in the yard and they are perfect for this because I can just rinse them off with the hose when I'm done. I ordered the Women's size 9. I usually wear an 8.5 but I listened to the reviews that said they ran small and boy am I glad I did! My toes just touch the end of the shoe. I would say they are about a 1/2 size too small. If I had to wear them for long periods while standing, they would be uncomfortable pretty quickly. So keep that in mind, if you're going to wear them for 8 hours at work. Overall I'm very happy with them.

  I have a great amount of difficulty finding comfortable shoes being one of my ankles is fused with pins & screws holding things together so not only is that foot a bit oddly shaped but because of all the trauma to my right leg, I am subject to profound swelling issues.  I am actually not sure about the arch support, but I also can't claim there isn't any, but since there was no option to be non-committal, I opted for the yes.  I do have a brace to wear on that leg with sneakers, but it becomes uncomfortable after a few hours and the clogs are light weight enough for me to use as an alternative both for several hours but also as a quick way to slip on to go outside to get the mail etc as I am mostly barefooted while at home.

  Pretty color, quite popular.  Crocs fit loose and these classic clogs are no exception.I only buy Croc brand because the cheaper knock offs quickly end up with a broken strap and worn bottoms that become quite slippery.My daughter is quite happy with her crocs

Great Christmas Present from Husband!
",Justin J,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  My husband bought these for me after I have been stealing his to wear in our basement.  These are so comfortable to wear for hours every day and are even better on my feet that they are actually the right size!  Part of our basement is unfinished and where our washer/dryer is and also our woodstove so we head to the basement quite frequently every day.  It is great to have a pair of shoes that you can slip on pretty quickly and go.  My feet are ALWAYS sore at the end of the night as well and these seem to have good enough support that my feet aren't as bad by the time I go to bed. Very happy with this purchase!

Great for puppy potty runs in the backyard
",Aggie11,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  When Crocs first were introduced back when I was a kid, my mom and I would constantly call these ""the ugliest garden shoes we'd ever seen."" However, fast forward to when we got our first puppy who has to make countless potty runs at all hours of the night, and these are the most appreciated shoes! They slip on and off without having to lift a finger, and they are incredibly light weight. They are the perfect shoe for roaming around the yard, where no one can see your silly ""garden shoes""! But really, in all honesty, we love our Crocs for making puppy potty runs!

  This is a roomy, comfortable shoe that I'm proud of so I gave it a 5-star rating. It's also easy to slip them on and off. I liked the price and free shipping which allowed me to save without waiting too long for them to arrive. These CROCS were made in Mexico and are a good fit as I expected. I recommend these to anyone who likes comfort and good fit.  My granddaughter works in an electrical plant which requires her to wear these shoes, so I recommend them to anyone who is required to wear them for work also. BTW, I don't believe these shoes are good for working outdoors doing yardwork as the soles are not intended for that purpose.

Crocs save the day
",Marianne B. King,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Love them.  Because of a botched surgery, my foot is deformed and I cannot wear normal shoes. I lived in Crocs for a long time.  I've been unable to walk without assistance for a long time, and it occurred to me that I needed to replace them, but the pair I had was purple, and it matched a lot of things in my world, clothes, my car! So I just knew that I had to replace them. I couldn't even read the size on the bottom they were so worn.  I couldn't find them in the size I needed due to swelling in my feet so I had to order a larger size.  Luckily they were available in my second favorite color.  I'm walking so much better!

  This is not a color I would normally have selected, but it was half the price of the other available colors. As this was my first pair of Crocs I figured I had nothing to lose at such a bargain price. What I didn't realize is how much I had to gain! I really, really like them!Crocs advises that half-sizes order the whole size down: I wear a US 9.5 shoe and ordered these in US 9: They are easily the equivalent of a US 10.

",Online Purchaser,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Good product. I deploy to bases with ""public use"" showers that everyone uses and this keeps your feet off the ground and clear of the mildew and other unmentionables on the shower floor. They turn white after a while a crack with constant hydration and dehydration of actually taking them into the shower but after 4-6 months of use, I would probably throw them away in that environment anyway no matter how they looked. Very comfortable to wear and just the thing for deployments. Sandals flop around too much.

  I've been thinking about getting crocs for a while but have been procrastinating. But after a day of swimming with my friend they all slipped on their crocs and it took me a whole 5 minutes to get my socks and shoes on, I said ""no more"" and order a pair that are my school colors, pepper, right when I got home. I am usually a 9.5 and I did as suggested by going down half a size but they are actually a bit big; however, with the sport strap, they fit perfectly! I really like them but I have high arches and the arch support is not the best.

The size was a little larger than expected, but not unreasonable.  I'm actually glad they are a little larger in hopes that the added size will help improve airflow.  I've owned this pair for about a month and they seem to be holding up ok.  I was much happier to pay the Amazon price as opposed to what the store was asking.

",David M. Craine,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I'm very pleased with these Crocs. Never had Crocs before, and I was hesitant about looking goofy, but these are the best knock-arounds I've had in years. I struggle finding slides that will stay on my feet, but these are great—they have the strap thingy in the back that also rotates to the front if you don't need it. Even without the strap, these stay on my feet better than any other slides I've owned. And the support is terrific—the first time I wore them I took a 2.5 mile walk and they were extremely comfortable. They run a little large. I usually wear a men's 10.5, but they don't have half sizes, so I got 10s. They fit great, and if anything might be a bit large. Inexpensive, durable, easy to clean, great for doing yard work, shopping, or whatever.

  Crocs really are the coolest. Not only was I able to score a pair for a mere $23.00, but they are true to size and are the best shoes for those of us who enjoy the ability of slipping shows on and off. Just be forewarned, when you first get them they will have a weird “wet” feeling. It will go away really Quickly though, in about a day or less. All in all, this was a great purchase and I would definitely buy them again in another color if I wasn’t so “thrifty-nifty.” :)

",Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I gottta say after wearing them for about a week now my feet are very happy! I mostly wear them around the house/yard and they're like walking on air - which is a nice feeling after being on my feet for 12hrs in a busy hospital. They're a simple slide on shoe as I leave work but the magic is in the performance racing strap - they don't annoyingly wiggle off your foot.No but really, super comfy and would recommend to a friend

Love kicking around the house and garden in these
",KayPW,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I've been looking for something easy to wear around the house and patio garden for quite some time and have always ended up settling for flip-flops which provide zero support. I've wondered about Crocs but have never tried them before. A friend mentioned she used them to garden in and I decided to order a pair. I'm very satisfied. They're comfortable, easy to slog on and off, and because of all the holes, my feet remain cool. The 9M is on the roomy side, but my feet are more wide than narrow. Still, they stay on my feet without use of the back strap. Good purchase!

",Andrea,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I know some people think they have arch support, but I don't feel any.  Then again, I need a really high arch in my shoes.  So take that for what it's worth.  I usually wear Birks, but I like to wear crocs around the house so I don't have to switch shoes if I'm gardening or washing dogs outside.  And when I bruised the bottom of my feet I needed to wear softer shoes for several weeks and crocs fit the bill.

",Keith,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  My girlfriend had a pair of Crocs that I loved slipping on, so I decided to get a pair.  I wear an 11 1/2 or 12 in shoes normally, but she had size Women's 11 / Men's 9 and they didn't seem too bad on my feet so I ordered the Women's 12 / Men's 10 size thinking they'd be one size bigger and be perfect.  They weren't, they were too small.  Thankfully it was no problem to return them and order one size bigger.  I picked the tan/khaki color and haven't regretted it for a second.  We even use them for stream-crossings while we're backpacking, and they were fantastic!

",Mom&Librarian,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I bought these brown Crocs to replace a pair of black ones that were becoming slick on the bottom after 10 years of wear. I use these for rain shoes, gardening and beach shoes. The older ones, from the day I opened them, were sturdy yet felt like walking on clouds. The new ones are made of completely different material. Its plastic, but not much give or flexibility. They do not feel like clouds, but they will serve their waterproof purpose. Sized exactly the same as the old ones. The brown color kind of faded-looking.

",J.Lee,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I was reluctant to try out these ugly clogs, but finally decided to see what the fuss was all about and took them on a trek in the Panama rain forest and wore them as a camp shoe for a week. Even though the Caymen is supposed to be a closer fit than the Beach, they still feel very loose, as if they're going to fall off, at first. But after getting used to them and forgetting I had them on, I realize that this contributes to the comfort. Unlike my usual sandals, these dry by simply wiping them off which is a huge benefit in wet environments. I still think they're fugly but they're extremely comfortable for wear around the house or camp, and light enough to always take with you on your travels.

  Crocs are awesome, and these are genuine, nothing more to sayCons -- Don't leave them in heat !!  I left mine on the porch in the sun for a day and they shrank literally a full size ( at least ).  I've been squeezing my feet into them because I'm stubborn and actually they are stretching back out to original size slowly but surely.  Just don't be stupid and always bring them in from outside, don't leave in your car in the sun, etc.

You made me love you. I didn't want to do it. I REALLY didn't want to do it!
",madamwillyoutalk,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Okay, so, let me get this review started off by saying I hate the way the original crocs look. I know, I know, so do a lot of people, but I really hate the way they look. I have always had large feet for a woman (10/10.5), so I really don’t like shoes that emphasize the fact that I am walking around with feet that could double as water skis at a moment’s notice.  As many of you have observed, these shoes are not very good at minimizing the appearance of the size of feet they are on.Okay, so now that I have my fussing out of the way, I love my crocs. To the point where if my house was on fire and I could save one pair of shoes, I would save my crocs.I was first introduced to crocs when I was 20 after I developed an almost crippling case of plantar fasciitis due to working a retail job where I wore heels on hard tiled floor for 10+ hours, 5-6 days a week. I could barely walk without being in excruciating pain. Not fun. I went to see a podiatrist who didn’t do any of the useful things most would have done like offering the night splints or anything like that. He said that I could do a series of injections in my feet, which sounded oh-so appealing, or I could do some stretches, stay off my feet as much as possible, and try wearing crocs whenever I could. I took option b.  I started wearing my crocs from the moment that I got up, until I had to go to work, where I now had a doctor’s note saying that I had to have comfortable, flat shoes.  I didn’t wear the crocs to work, that would have been pushing it, but I did wear the most comfortable shoes I could without making my department manager’s eye twitch when she looked at them. Then, as soon as I got home, I would take them off, and put my crocs back on. The pain lessened almost immediately, and while it was a combination of keeping off my feet, the stretches, and the crocs, the shoes were definitely the most important factor. They helped so much that I wore them outside of the house while running errands. Within a month, the pain had gone from an all-day, all-consuming factor, to something bothered me for only one hour after waking. After two months, I didn’t even need to wear them anymore, so I stopped.Fast-forward five and a half years and I am pregnant with my first child and the crocs came out yet again. They were my best friends during the second and third trimester and I haven’t put them up since. For some reason, probably partially due to the way I sleep, which allows my muscles in my calves and ankles to tense up really well, I have had a mild problem ever since having my daughter. It isn’t debilitating like the first time, it only hurts for about 10 minutes when I first get up in the morning and I am stretching my muscles out, but I wear my crocs at all times when I am in the house.  My husband, whom I met after my first experience with crocs teased me about them quite a lot. He is European and thinks that crocs are some bizarre American fashion statement and had an excellent time laughing at them. But he also has a job where he is on his feet all day, and a month ago he started showing symptoms of plantar fasciitis. I gave him my crocs to wear around the house, remember, I have giant feet, and they went up a size due to my pregnancy to boot (11) , and he has wears a 10.5 in men’s shoes, so while mine were a little tight, they were comfortable enough. He stopped giving me any grief after he spent a few days clomping around the house in my bright purple crocs. After I peeled myself off the floor after a very satisfying guffaw I got him to admit that they were really helping and that he didn’t want to walk around without them anymore. Victory is mine! So, because I wanted me crocs back, guess what he got for Christmas? A lovely pair of plain, black crocs all his own.Now, I’m not a doctor or nurse of any kind, but I can tell that these have really helped my husband and I ease the pain from, and in my earlier case eliminate, a painful condition. Are they pretty? No. Have they worked for us? Yes.I have a pair of size Women's 11 crocs right now and they are perfect for walking around the house, but they are a bit loose, I wouldn't want to try to sprint in them. I have wide feet, and they are perfectly roomy, not tight at all.I bought my husband a Men's size 10, he usually wears a 10.5, and they are a little roomy for him as well, but not to the point where it is an issue. So, judging from my experience, these run a little large and wider than average.

",Claire,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I haven’t had a pair of crocs in 15 years so I really relied on reviews for this purchase. I’m between a size 9 and 10 (usually 9.5) so I ordered the 10s. I bought them as year round house shoes and I love them! They fit JUST RIGHT without the wrap down on the back with thicker socks. When the strap is down they slightly push my toes into the top. I’ve read they will stretch out but even if they don’t I’m not mad about it. I’m grateful that I got them every time I put them on.

Roomy but comfortable
",Michael,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  As other purchasers have noted, the sizing of Croc brand clogs is off. I would guess that these and the pair of Croc Sport clogs are a full size larger than the number sizing would indicated. Because these are clingy to the foot, they don't shift around despite the sizing so we chose not to exchange for a smaller size. Previous non-Croc branded clogs we've owned shrank over time, especially when exposed to a lot of sun so it is possible that Croc brands do the same and account for the generous sizing. Overall, the build quality is quite good and these Crocs are comfortable.

",Della,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Honestly, I was confused about the sizing. I have bought many of these shoes over the years for my son but always found that the ones marked from Mexico to be far too small. So I naturally bought them bigger thinking that the same issues in the past would still be true. I was wrong. My bad.

Crocs - replace when worn!
",Arkay,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have wide feet and these are medium width, so they are a tad snug width-wise. But for me it's not uncomfortable. I've had many pairs of Crocs over the years and know the feel. These are typical. I wear Crocs until the treads are worn off then get a replacement pair (worn down Crocs are dangerously slippery on wet surfaces).

They provide great support for my feet and I love how light they are.  I am glad there are holes in the uppers of these shoes.  Without them they would be to hot to wear.  I am completely unfashionable since I always wear socks with mine.  I don't care if people cringe when they see me in them.

WISH THEY WERE AVAILABLE WHEN I WAS A KID!
",L. H. Pearson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Clogs beat slippers hands down! I wear them with socks most of the time I'm lounging around the house in winter and know I can wear them outside for brief errands and not have to change footwear. With the socks they're warm in winter; without socks in summer, just right. I even wear them boating and swimming! They float in the water if they come off. Great for when the water's bottom is slimy, pebbly or mucky. Virtually no maintenance and wear like steel.

",Naliyah Price,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  When I received my crops they came in a clear packaging. The shoes really do fit true to size. At first they may fit a little snug at the tip of your toes but the first time you wear them they will adjust to your feet. I ordered the color “Blossom”. Real cute on my feet and super comfy. It’s like I’m walking on foam.

The fit I remember.
",Santa Settles,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Crocs are about the only shoes I wear due to my wide foot and particularly high arch. My last pair of crocs were a different style and they were considerably narrower. I was delighted that these were the comfortable width I was used to with previous pairs. I held back one star because the footbed feels thinner than it used to be... walking on a gravel path these feel more like a year old pair than brand new. Still, very happy.

Incredibly comfortable
",Jociegi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  There was a time when I might have been embarrassed to be seen wearing such a gawky shoe but having achieved the ripe old age of 66 those times are past. These shoes are very very comfortable, with great support for the entire foot. They do run a bit large so I think I could have gone down a half size. Since they are a clog, however, with the grippy bottom, I have not felt like they would slip off. A bonus that they can get soaking wet with no problem. Wish I had discovered them sooner

  I love the Crocs, I have been wearing them for years for sore feet. I first saw them being worn by a chef on TV and thought they were rather unattractive but decided to try a pair anyway. Boy am I glad I did, they're super comfortable and with the fur lined ones I'm able to wear them year around. They are especially light weight and they do have arch support. In the summer I wear ones with vents in the top and sides, they're as light as flip-flops but offer protection for my feet.

I needed a pair of shoes to just throw on an wear them around my dorm. My friend convinced me that crocs were the perfect solution. I ordered them and they came on time for a pretty reasonable price. I also got some jibbitz to accessorize them and make them unique to myself. The jibbitz also help me to know which ones are mine when distinguishing them from other pairs of crocs. I now have power ranger jibbitz and a really cool alligator jibbit that looks like it is swimming. The purchase of crocs was one of my best decisions and I get a lot of compliments on them. The other day I saw someone with hot pink ones and I think that might be my next purchase.

I don't care how many times i've been told how ugly these are. They are comfy!
",Kate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  The first pair I had were a knock off brand and I got these hoping they would last longer. It's been at least a year and they have. I mainly wear these around the house and the patio. I have bad knees and the cushion in these really help. They are really light weight also. Barely seems like you are wearing anything. I like wearing them while I'm cooking (careful of hot liquid, won't protect from burns) or doing dishes. Also good when you have to be on your feet a long time cleaning and vacuuming. Not good on hot days. Wear with socks if you plan to wear them all day. The grip on the sole is much better than the off brand ones. Still won't wear them on wet ground after slipping badly with my old ones. I do use them as pool shoes though. Buy them a little bigger than you would think because if they are too tight and you wear them without socks you can get blisters easily. My friends kid wears these all the time and he gets blisters because he runs in them. The off brand ones I originally bought i told myself they were for gardening. After slipping a few too many times and being freaked out by bugs crawling in the little holes and I don't use them for that anymore. I have been told many times how ugly these are and i tell the people to try mine on and see how comfy they are. They agree and then say not to wear them in public ha ha.

Good for Short Walks (dogs/chores)
",Marcy,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Bought these to walk the dogs throughout the day (usually for 20 minutes). Also use them when watering plants/shrubs outside, getting mail, or throwing out trash.  More comfortable than flip-flops as they provide no arch support and you can't really walk fast in them.  Have not worn them longer than one hour.  They fit as expected b/c the description does say they run a little large.  I normally wear a 6.5 so I purchased the Women's 6 US.  You have to get used to the cushioning/padding inside.  They're textured with little plastic nubs that massage your soles as you walk. B/c I don't wear socks, when I take them off and walk on the carpet, there's a strange sensation on the soles of my feet. Not really a complaint, but I can see why it might not be ideal for all-day wear.

  I prefer to wear shoes around the house; but I have ""outside"" and ""inside"" shoes.  These fit the bill for ""inside"" shoes.  I can wear them with socks (winter) or with out (summer).  They are great for using in the kitchen.  I  cook a lot and it's not out of the norm to get something on them.  A quick scrub in the utility sink and they are good to go.  I usually get a new pair every other year (they do get worn out).  Love the Garnet color!

Great cheap minimalist Crocs
",Franz Kafka,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  The basic Crocs design, which this model represents, is classic. I use it exclusively as my indoors 'shoe'--when I enter the house, my outside (dirty) shoes come off and the Crocs go on. They're also waterproof, so you can use them in the shower, or at the pool or beach, if you wish. I bought my first pair 5 years ago, and it's indestructible; I only bought this second pair because I needed it to use on vacation. The shoe sizes are generous--I'm a size 12 but wear a size 11 Crocs--so it might pay to try on a few sizes in a store before purchasing it.

  This is my fourth set of Crocs clogs, and apparently they're running a little smaller than they used to. That, or my feet got longer. I wish Crocs came in half sizes, but oh well.Comfortable & convenient, but don't wear these if you're doing any real walking. Blister city on the top of a foot sans socks. If anything, the worst thing I can say about these plastic shoes is they wear out faster than most other shoes. At least they're priced cheap enough I don't mind having to replace them every year (or less).

  These fits as expected & seem comfortable. This is my first time buying Crocs because I was looking for a new type of shoe to wear around the house rather, than flip flops or western boots, so Im trying these. The sole has a bumpy texture, which im not used to, but if I can get used to that I think these will work great. The plastic on the outside seems decently solid while the inside is semi spongy & comfortable. Since im rough on my foot wear this is a bonus. Hopefully these will last a little while!

I don't think I've ever felt this happy before. THEY FRACKING ROCK!!!! I got the bright red ones in men's size 11, and while they were a bit large, they were perfect in every other aspect. Yes, they did change the sizing a bit, so they're very roomy, but I don't care. I love them! 10/10 would recommend.

  Replaced a similar pair from 10 years earlier.  Fit is a little different, but still can wear the same size without going up or down (but still over-sized compared to my usual street shoe size).  Now has more  vent holes at the very front of toe, which unfortunately lets in water when walking through dewey grass or shallow snow.  I may tape one or 2 of those vents closed.

Most fashionable? Not really. Comfortable, practical, and durable? Definitely.
",joseph,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Awesome shoes. Adjust the swiveling back securing foot strap and you can wear it all day like any other sandal. I've tried very hard to make them slip off and I couldn't get them to slip off accidentally. Leave the swiveling back securing foot strap towards the front of the shoe and you have a quick and easy slip op show or sandal. The shoe's design is very airy. Obviously you feet will get cold on a cold day, but it's refreshing. I would buy it again, but it's unlikely that'll i'll have to buy another because the Crocs feel solidly built and durable.Note that the shoe is typically larger that average shoe sizes, but frankly it's not a big deal. Mine was a bit larger than my actual foot, but the loose feel is very nice. The shoes don't come off even though they are a tad big.

  What's not too like about crocs? They last forever.  Sizing has changed since I bought my last pair as they used to be mens 10-11 now it is size 10 or 11. I think I read somewhere on crocs website if you wear a half size to order a size down.  The size 10 fit well.  My suggestion would be to try them on at a store and then order them on amazon as the price is better.  This way there should be no sizing issues. I think I paid $23.75 for my current pair and the prime shipping is always nice.

Durable, comfortable, all-weather
",Michael Brenner,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  This footwear fit my needs perfectly.  I was looking for all-weather, all-terrain footgear that is quick to put on and quick to take off.  Slip-on's were a must.  I use them for walking around outside my house, which means I'm walking in dirt, grass, on cement, on a wooden deck, and so forth.  I also use them for boating on a pontoon boat and for general, quick around-town use.  These clogs fit the bill perfectly.  They are durable, don't get dirty easily, are very easy to clean, and provide the foot with protection without stifling the foot.  I'm very satisfied with this product.  One caveat only - they wear a bit small in size for me, so I had to order a half-size larger than shoe size.  I'm a 10 1/2 in shoe size, and a size-11 croc fit perfectly.

  To get the correct size, order one size up from your shoe size. These are great, just like my crocs from 2008. I got them for my boyfriend.

Large for size but good quality
",Andrew78,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  The 13 was too small and the 14 was too large (and wide), until I threw them in the dryer on high for 3-4 minutes. After that they fit perfectly. Make sure you put them on and walk around with them before they cool completely (since heating warps them and you need to straighten them out). These crocs are great and I plan to wear them all summer.

",Grandma Barbara,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I bought these to replace my fist pair of Crocs and I still love them. I have several pairs and they are just about all that I wear. I was a bit worried about the fit because I had read several reviews that said they were not as wide as they once were but these were just fine and I do have wide feet. My old Crocs had really worn down and I wear the black ones the most, so I was glad to find these at Amazon. If you want really comfortable shoes and don't care how they look, give Crocs a try, you will probably never look back.

Plantar fasciitis

  My feet have been killing me! I bought these in desperation to save them. They feel very comfortable. 9 men fit perfectly. I wear a 9.5 sneaker. I use them strictly in the house and I bought ortho inserts for my NB running sneakers. They say not to walk barefoot for a while but these crocs are nice in the house and easy to clean. I went to the doctors and got a inflammatory gel which is working great. I had plantar fasc for almost 6 mos in both feet. So with the combination of these three things I'm starting to feel better.

  I purchased these to replace a pair of these I got about 8 years ago. Obviously, these things last forever. These cost 4 times as much as they did back then, but who could complain about that when you figure the lifespan. I, finally wore the bottoms completely smooth, which becomes hazardous on wet cement. I don't remember the insides being this bumpy as the new ones, maybe I wore those off too. Fortunately the size imprint was still on the sole, making ordering new ones simple. Size 10 is still size 10.

CROCS ROCK
",debbieingermany,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I began wearing Crocs when I had my first bout with plantar fasciitis several years ago.  I don't know the hows or whys, but the Croc stabilizes my foot and gives support to help my feet not hurt.  I wear them around the house and occasionally when I go shopping.  But for every day wearing around the house shoe, there is nothing better for support and comfort.  My neighbor even thought my yellow ones were cool.  I like different colors and there are so many to chose from. My mom and dad began wearing Crocs also when they helped my feet.  They wear them every where.  Great shoe!

  I live in Crocs, as almost all other shoes hurt some part of my feet.  I liked the shine of these, rather than the dull finish I am used to.  My friend had crippling arthritis in both feet.  She had to give up all walking.  Her podiatrist told her she could not wear any shoes, ever, other than Crocs.  After she did that, she was able to resume her very long walks.  With that as an example, I wondered if Crocs would work for me - and find that they do.

Very comfortable shoe
",cooknot801,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  You can't beat the classic clog for comfort.  I'm on my feet a lot in my work, and my feet stay comfortable throughout the shift.  I like to wear a gel insole in them for a little extra padding, and that makes them even more comfortable.  The only downside I find with these shoes is that as they age and the little nubs on the bottom wear off they become very slippery on certain surfaces.  Other than that, they're the perfect shoe for someone on their feet a lot.

These new crocks fit like a glove!! So if you've had your crocks for a long time, I suggest they may have expanded, as mine did. Time for these new ones that come in lovely colors and actually fit your foot once again. I also love having the good grip on the bottoms.

  This is my favorite style of crocs. I have found that they gotten smaller over the last 2 years.  My crocs in this same style that I bought 3 years ago are larger.  They are more comfortable.

I literally live in them at home.  I have 5 pairs in different colors:)  My feet and knees have quit hurting thanks to these shoes.

I'm conflicted.
",Adam R.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I'm not supposed to go barefoot excessively due to plantar fasciitis, so I bought these Crocs because I was looking for something supportive and easy to slip on that I could wear exclusively inside to avoid tracking dirt through the house (also, they came in size 15, which is hard to find). On the one hand, I love these shoes--they are perhaps the most comfortable I own. On the other hand, they are horrifically ugly. I suppose that works out for the best--it makes it easy to remember that they are for the house only.

Crocs are a good fit and quality product
",casual user,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Shipment arrived and one of the straps was not attached correctly.  Reported issue, was sent a replacement, returned defective pair, happy ending.Really pleased with the return process and appreciated how well it worked.  Have worn this brand foe a number of years now.  Always found them to be of good, long lasting quality.  Product holds up well with repeat wearings.  Straps last, soles last a long time. Ease of use was what I was looking for, and this product fit the bill.  Find I use them on most days that it is not raining or really cold out.

If you already own crocs, mind the shoe size
",Junebug Jones,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  My girlfriend had an old pair of crocs, which I coveted.  So I finally decided to buy myself a pair on amazon. I based my size on the pair my GF had... which tended toward the small size.  As in: her lady size 9 fit my lady size 10 foot.  But when my new crocs arrived in the mail they were too small.  Should've ordered at 10. Which is my foot size.  Let this be a cautionary tale for you, weary traveler: Buy the shoe size you are, not the half-forgotten-dream of a shoe size your girlfriend wears.

These were a lot of fun for summer
",Chris G.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  For some reason my flip flops that I have been wearing the same kind for 15 years now kill my knees and back.  I switched to Crocs and am able to wear them normally.  These were a lot of fun for summer.  I've worn them to the water, parks, hiking, camping, wading in the river.  Held up great everywhere.  I assumed they would look grimy very quick, but they still look great!

Amazing Relaxing Shoes For Hiking and Camping!
",AmznRoxs,5.0 out of 5 stars,"


  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


   I never though about getting crocs until a good friend, who hikes days at a time in Yosemite every year takes crocs with him strapped to his trekking backpack. When I went with him this year I soon realized how awesome the crocs where. Whenever we camped or stopped by a river he would switch out his shoes and socks and slip on the crocs and off he went into the stream, river, or lake with no worries of stepping on rough rocks, sticks or whatever was underneath or rocks and boulders that are above the water. I didn't have any crocs at the time so I had to walk with my bare feet if I wanted to go in. They also made great camping shoes when setting up camp and just relaxing. Needless to say I was convinced and bought some for myself and my wife. We used them on a recent overnight hiking trip. Amazing shoes!

  Initially I couldn't wear the shoes for very long because I'm missing cartilage in one knee.

Replace your old crocks and see what a difference it makes to have all the ""new"" features once again. I didn't realize how worn out my old pair were until the new ones arrived.

  I was concerned about the fit when ordering. I take size 9B and have successfully worn the unisex All Stars in size 7 men/9 women. So I ordered the same in these Crocs and they are comfortable, lightweight, easy to clean after garden work, and well ventilated for Florida weather. Too bad the public seems to find them hideous to look at, but I purchased them for around the house and garden anyway so I give them 5 stars. I am contemplating a second pair in black.

Super Functional Footwear
",NH,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  This is my second set of khaki Crocs, I love them. Perfect footwear around house, going to store, camping, beach even water parks. I have flat feet so minimal arch does not bother me, I have occasionally put orthotics in them for extra support (plenty of room), good cushioning in heel and ball of foot, I am a 14 EE and 14 M fit comfortably. I have several Crocs now, will almost certainly always own a few from now on. Only caveat is that they get slippery on smooth surfaces when bottoms gets worn, be careful transitioning from wet out doors to supermarket floors or other smooth surfaces (ATM, etc.)

She absolutely loves the color and doesn't mind them being a little bigger than she needs. She's had several pairs of kids crocks in the past and they have always withstood everything.

They are wearable
",Kathleen Wagner,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  They're very wide but because of the  mass of tiny protrusions on the insole of the shoe they seem to hang onto the foot well and keep them from feeling too wide.  They also massage the foot which I find comfortable. They are light and wearable but are not perfect.  I give them a 4 rating.

Super comfortable, consistently great product
",chicago esquire,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Not the best looking clogs, but dang are they the most comfortable.  If you have lower back pain, this cushioning capabilities of these clogs will soften any impact on your back.  Super comfortable.  The only problem I have with this product is the price is high considering what this shoe is made of.  Other than that, it is really the most comfortable clog and I wear these around the house all the time

Very comfortable
",Carol Pittman,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Even though the chart said to round down to the nearest size if you wear, for example 8 1/2 go to 8, I went to a 9 since I was going to be wearing thermal socks with them a I ordered them to wear in the winter due to a toe condition. The size 9 fit perfectly with the socks on, but the shoe will probably be a little big to wear without socks in the summer. They are very comfortable shoes. I gave a 4 rather than a 5 star as the straps are a slightly different length on each shoe.

Crocs - pillows for your feet!

  Fits like a Croc. Feels like you’re walking on a cloud. Very lightweight, can wear them all day and not have sore feet at the end of it. Two-wheel drive for easy slipping on and off, four-wheel drive if you’re getting saucy! No half sizes, so definitely go up if you’re in between.

NAVY BLUE CROCS
",Susan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Same as Crocs sold in stores at the mall. Was glad I didn't have to drive 30 miles to get some! Fit is perfect; however, I wear custom-made orthotics, which slide out the back end (as the back isn't high enough to accommodate them); however, have found if I put 2 stapes from a staple gun straight down into the top of the back part of each shoe (side by side horizontally, but lift the staple up 1/16 of an inch after putting them in), this is just enough to hold the orthotics in, and the staples have not fallen out, even after walking or exercising. Would buy again!

Crocs are just about the only footwear I can wear ...
",MJK,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Crocs are just about the only footwear I can wear, having lots of foot problems, especially since I have wide forefoot and very narrow heel.  The wide forefoot is a result of bone spurs; and shoe mfrs do not make wide shoes with narrow heels, therefore, if I buy wide shoes, they slip off me, but if I buy medium width, my feet would hurt from rubbing on the bone spurs.  This type of Crocs is my answer to my foot problem.

While they aren't the most stylish or shoes. at my age ( 60 year old male) who cares?!Look, if you don't love Crocs, then you just don't get Crocs.

My first pair of Crocs and I love 'em!
",Little Frog,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  This is my first pair of Crocs and I love them!  I have a wide foot and comfort is key.  Crocs reminded me of the white ""earth shoes"" I wore back in the 70's & 80's while working in the medical field.  I remembered they weren't the most attractive shoes (looked like I had ""duck feet"") but they were comfortable.  I have friends that wear Crocs and decided to give them a try.  I usually wear an 8-1/2 or 9 and was torn between sizes.  Crocs recommends you order down to the next whole size if you are in-between sizes.  I ordered Classic Crocs / size W9 and I thought they were slightly longer than I needed so I ordered an 8 to be sure.  The length of the foot bed for the 8 was fine but I found the toe box to be a little snug on my littlest toe.  I kept the 9's and am glad I did.  I work in an office of a manufacturing plant with a casual dress code. Most of the building has concrete floors and the Crocs are just perfect for me.  I have since bought another pair in a different color and a pair of Crocs sandals.  The Classic Crocs clogs have ventilation so my feet don't get too hot like they might have in some of the closed styles.  I know Crocs have been around a long time and I don't know why it took me so long to try a pair.  I'm very happy I did.

  A while back, my mom had found crocs at a local store that fit perfectly, but she wanted some more colors of them.  This style seemed to match what she had, and fit so well, and this works perfectly-- she has problems with swelling in her feet, but wearing these crocs instead of other shoes, she doesn't have the problems.  She doesn't feel like she has to jam her foot into these crocs because there is just enough room for her foot.  She likes them a lot!!

Crocs are great for work.
",bargainhunter,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I work in a hospital and these are great and comfortable. The best thing is that my feet breathe and don't get smelly like a canvas or leather lace up or even slip on do. I have a box full of other canvas/leather lace ups that degrade inside over time as well as slip on famous brands that have now become my garden shoes as I can't wear them anymore for daily work as they wore out. Another thing is that you can wash crocs and these don't lose shape or fall apart inside.

  Just a little too big.  The only thing I don't like about crocs is the size you need depends on the style.  I ordered the same size as other crocs I have but these are bigger.  I guess you really should to go through croc's website to check they're information on sizing of a particular style and then order where ever you want.  These will fit great with socks, but are loose without.  For wet summer weather, I guess I'll just slosh around a bit.  Love the color of these blue crocs, almost matches jeans exactly.

  This is my third pair of crocs in this open style, and I like them very much. I use two canes or a walker for balance due to a bad R hip and the wide soles on these shoes help in that regard. Also, I like the way the heel strap can be pushed toward the front to turn these shoes into slup-ons. My only problem with them is the slant at the back of the heel. If I'm on a slight incline, I must the careful not to lean back too far.

  These are much more attractive than most croc shoes. The only problem is that these are size 9, I wear an 8 1/2 and they are alittle too large. It is too bad Crocs doesn't have half sizes. These are very comfortable and easy to throw on to wear inside or outside.

The ugly things arrived and I slipped my feet into them and felt as though I was walking on clouds.

  I think this is my fifth or sixth pair of Crocs and they've all been great. I have two very arthritic ankles that don't like anything in the way of impacts or jarring and Crocs are basically all a pad, so they really help keep the ankles happy. The new ones always feel a little weird with the fresh nubs on the inside, but I adjust quickly. (My older Crocs have the nubs pretty much worn down.)

My Crocs

  These are being worn by people from 1-101 and I was curious.  Well, I'm not curious anymore; I am delighted.  Crocs are light-weight, comfortable enough to wear around the house or on those extensive window-shopping outings.  They are easy to get on and off (and believe me, with arthritis, that is important).  I wear them with the strap over the top for quick slip-on/off and with the strap down when lots of walking in anticipated. Either way, they are great. And, yes, I will be buying Crocs again.

  Buying crocs can be a touch and go situation depending on the type and where they are made. These are made in Mexico and the fit is very good. I have purchased the Bistro version also. They are made in China on what appears to be different mold sizes. They tend to be either too tight or too loose, depending on size. This is a shame because they are more attractive without the vent holes.

Weightless, comfy, but tiny break in period
",Sparky,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Newbies: Wearing Crocs is not like wearing shoes. They weigh next to nothing and are cushiony without feeling spongy. Your feet don't have to 'grab' them to stay on: you walk effortlessly, even with the backstrap worn forward over your arch, like clogs. They are waterproof, so the shoes are great for gardening, and the ventilation holes will help your feet breathe; you don't have to wear socks, but I do to avoid any hint of sweaty feet. That's not a real problem for me, but feet vary.  After a short period of wearing them, they become even less noticeable as they conform to your feet. Two days later, most of you won't remember any problems, if you had them. Note: They will wear out eventually, especially if you wear them frequently on concrete. Replace them when the soles wear down, before they become dangerously slippery.Previous users: Remember that new Crocs won't fit like the old ones. The need time to adapt to your feet, particularly the backstrap, which will feel shorter at first.All: Khaki is a wonderful dust color for summer wear. Chocolate is not exactly milk chocolate or bittersweet. It's got a bit of green tinge, which makes it quite attractive for brown feet.

",Ms. Annette,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Good quality. Fit somewhat small. My husband wears a size 11 so that is why i ordered this pair. They do fit but with no room to spare. His heel comes right to the end. He decided to keep them because he doesn't wear them out and about he uses them as slippers and to let the dogs out and play catch. But the fit is obvious when you look at him.

  These do stretch out a little bit over time(very little).  But they are extremely comfortable, wear slowly and clean very easily. Only gripe is they tend to be slippery on wet surfaces...

",GFM,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Have been wearing the Bistro (no holes) model for a year and loving them: light, comfortable, roomy and easy to get on and off--so I thought I would try the perforated model.  I normally take a mens size 10 in other types of shoes, but for both the Bistro and Classic Clog, I got mens size 9 and, for me, they fit perfectly:  Roomy, but stay put on my foot.  Besides the holes, the only other difference between the two models appears to be the tread pattern.  I'm retired and now able to enjoy the opportunity to wear what's comfortable--not what's expected at work.

Fantastic for swollen, pregnant feet
",Roo99,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I'm 7 months pregnant, and in the summer, my feet get very swollen.  I was down to 2 pair shoes that I could wear to work (closed toes shoes) and saw these on sale.  I was looking at Crocs for sometime, but was balking at the $34 price tag.  These were on sale, so I figured I might as well.  Oh, my fat feet are happy.  Good support, and they stretch with my feet throughout the day, so no pinching.  They do seem to shrink overnight, because they don't seem overly large the next day.  Obviously not very fashionable, but I was not looking for fashion, just shoes I could wear in semi-comfort.  I usually wear a 7.5/8 women's, and ordered these in a women's 8, which are fitting well.Additionally, at the end of the day if I need to slip on shoes for whatever reason, these are the only ones which I can stuff my feet into without pain, pinching, or having to try and bend down and adjust straps.  Would highly recommend to people who have swollen feet, looking for comfort and are willing to sacrifice a little fashion for a whole lot of comfort.

",Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Just a word of warning. There are very comfortable. But they tend to run large. They only fit as expected because I bought them a size too small. Usually wear a 9 or 9.5 US, but I wear an 8 in these, and there's lots of toe room. Other than that, I couldn't be happier with them. I've also bought a pair without the holes for ""formal"" occasions. My wife will not let me wear them with my tux, but other than that, she's okay with them.

  These are classic Crocs. You may not score fashion points but the comfort and convenience of Crocs is unrivaled. However if you wear a 8.5 or 39 in European size order the size Men's 7/ Women's 9; Crocs sizing is 39-40 because the size 8 Women's / Men's 6; Crocs size 38-39 was on the small side..my toes were hitting the tops of the shoe..

Very comfortable. Great for my intended uses to replace flip ...
",Lewis R.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Very comfortable. Great for my intended uses to replace flip flops and to dry my feet out after walking around in boots or being wet all day.  However, the site suggested going up half a size if you are inbetween. I generally wear a 9.5 military boot or a 10 in regular shoes. I went with a 10, and the back strap barely catches on my heel as I take a step.  Fine for walking around on dry ground, indoors, at the pool etc.  However, it's a bit too large to walk around in muck, submerged water (creeks etc) because it just isn't tight enough.  If I purchased again I would actually go down half a size.

  I'm so happy with my crocs! These were my very first pair, they are a little big because i am normally an 8.5 and they didn't half the half size so I went to a 9 but I still absolutely love them! They came on time and were packaged well I have had them for about a week and I loved them so much I went and bought them in black.

Very comfortable shoes
",Sandy Hays,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I ordered these shoes for my husband for Christmas.  He is so clueless when it comes to comfortable footwear.  He only buys these big ol' New Balance shoes, in extra wide, from Big 5 when they go on sale.  He has started to have lower back pain and I think it's because of his choice of footwear.  He's a big guy... retired football coach.  He says he loves the way the shoes fit.  His only problem is how they look.  Says he'll wear them, but he just can't look down at them.  And to avoid being attacked ""Duck Dynasty style"", I will not tell what he says when he does happen to glance down at his feet...

From a Catholic to a Crocoholic
",Ariana,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Let me start by saying one thing: I never thought I would own crocs.Here is my coming of Croc story.I always thought these shoes were so ugly. I first saw them about 8 years ago and thought ""Why would someone ever put something like that on their feet?"" and people would always say how comfortable they were. I just thought they were dumb to think wearing this shoe was okay.Well go into the futre to now, I am a graduate nurse whos feet are killing her on 12hr shifts. So I decide to give them a try.Now I am a converted crocoholic. I love these shoes, I even made my other new nurse friends buy them lolThey are honestly so comfortable on my feet, and when unsightly things spill on them, you can just wipe them off.I also love that you may or may not use the strap in the back, sometimes I like to be scandalous and let my heels out and other times I like to wear the straps around my ankles (call me bojangles).But for real, if you have never tried these before, you should. They are worth the one time try- and then you will be addicted.

  I cannot stop wearing these and I only received them earlier today. I do not regret this purchase and the only remotely negative thing I have to say is that the color is a lot brighter than I expected. It’s more of a bubblegum pink.

My second pair in 12 years
",James Q. Smith,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are made in Mexico, those back in 2000, were made in China.  There is a slight difference in size, as these are a tad wider but the material, fit, comfort, and quality are the same.Prosvery comfortable as a clog, tend to be on the wide size for shoes and now even widerno smell with bare feeteasy to clean, just rinse with water over an open spigot with your feet still in themdurable, the sole has worn over 12 years but my old shoe is still usablelightweightresists deterioration with sunlight very well, my old shoe is faded but very intactEasy to done like a slipper yet holds firm with foot strapsConsSlippery in water, it can hydroplane easily.  If you use these to walk on water, such as walking into a pool, puddle, or boat, make sure you plant your feet down firmly to insure it contacts surface wellShoes sizes always tended to be towards the big end, you have to get used to free play inside the shoe

",C. Wharton,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are great quality and very comfortable.  I bought these for my son because I have my own pair and wear them everywhere.  You can wear them with thick socks or bare foot.  They clean up easily with warm water and soap.  They really hold up well.  The only thing to be aware of is to not leave them sitting out in the sun.  They will shrink or warp if left to sit in the sun for a long period of time.

",Grandma Sandy,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I purchased a pair of this same shoe several years ago to help with plantar faciitis. They worked like a miracle for me. I have worn them down to where the inside and bottom are completely  smooth. So I decided to order the same shoe again.  I ordered the same size as before, but the new ones are a little smaller. But, thats a good thing because the 1st pair was a little  big.  Both pair still fit well even with the slight difference in size. When I wear this new pair out, I'm sure I will order another pair.

  Are they ugly?  Yep.Should you wear them to the office, opera or on a date?  Nope.Are they awesome for shower/beach/lounging shoes?  ABSOLUTELY.  You can beat the C*@$ out of crocs and they're still completely functional.  My only gripe is that the sizing is a solid half to full size big.  Ex., I normally wear a 9-9.5 shoe/boot.  These size 9 crocs are pretty big on me.

  It's so hard to find shoes to fit my husband's 16.5 eeeeee foot. Almost to my delight, these run a little big (still room to grow!. The vendor was very accommodating with refunding a pair that was a size too big. We ordered the next size down and my conservative, stodgy fashion sense husband loves them for easy slip on and wear around the homestead shoes! Plus they still have a little room lengthwise... Nothing to do with the vendor, just wish Croc had a pair of these that are enclosed for rainy days!

  I think this is my 5th pair of Crocs. I can't think of another pair of shoes that are this versatile and comfortable at the same time.  Albeit they may not wear as slow as they used to. What I particularly like is that I can wash them and dry them with a towel and be on my way.

it could be any size like 8. 9
",Bukovski,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Sizes do not match. if the description says it is 9, then it should be 9. With the croc I got, the size on it, it is 9, but it actually is 10. In other words if you ordered 2 Crocs with size 9, you might a get somehow a smaller or larger even though both Crocs are labeled as 9. (9 is an example, it could be any size like 8. 9. 10 etc.)

Crocs are good casual shoes.
",Rennyrij,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I like Crocs, but I wear them because my podiatrist told me they'd be better for me, after the plantar fasciitis.  I can usually wear them with the thicker socks.  They do make my feet sweat, so I take them off from time to time, and if my socks are too wet I remove them, too, and find a dry pair.  Not so bad in the summer, but it can be chilly in the winter.

  This shoe fit a little smaller than the same ones I ordered a couple years ago.

Crocks Classic; Always Great!
",heretolearn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I bought these for my son who loves them. I've worn Crocks Classics for years, and love their convenience, breathe-ability, and cleanse-ability. They are great gardening or on-the-run shoes that give support and protection, but can be tossed about anywhere as they're nearly indestructible! In time their tread will wear down, and you could continue to use them, but because their not costly, I just replace them. I wear mine nearly daily, and they last well for 2 years+.

Comfy sandals, but gets dirty easily
",j&a,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are great casual lightweight sandals that are cushy and mold to your feet.  They are also great for wearing in/around water.  I bought a pair for myself and my hubby, who loves his as well.  Our only complaint is that these sandals get dirty easily.  We both got black, so it is always a little dusty on the outside (makes it look like dark grey), and when we wear around the yard or around town, we often get dust, pebbles, and grass in our shoes.  I suppose if you wore them where there was zero debris on the ground, they'd be the perfect shoes!  They are also easy to clean, however - just damp paper towel or cloth wipes it clean.  Fairly good traction below, too.

",Drsuis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have been wearing Crocs for a long time.  This is my first review.  I am a large man with wide feet.  I have a bad knee that makes tying shoes very painful.  Slip-on mules and clogs are the ticket for me, and Crocs are the answer.  Whenever they go on sale, I consider buying another pair.  The only downside is that the sole tread seems to wear out to quickly in my opinion.  I like the quick and free shipping with Amazon Prime.

  I go back and forth from my shop maybe fifteen times day.  To avoid tracking in dirt or sawdust into the house, these can be kicked off and put back on without bending over.  If you need to do something that requires good footing you probably want to put on something more substantial with laces.  Because of their fit they can slip off sometimes too easily so be aware that they're not appropriate for all activities.

I don't like wearing shoes or sneakers when I'm inside and slippers cause my feet to get too hot - not very supportive either.  So remembering my comfortable croc sandals I decided to try a clog.  I'm so glad that I did.  I can wear them w/or without socks and they are very comfortable.  I have happy feet and that makes me very happy!

",Jennifer Morphis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I ended up buying up one size in these shoes from what I normally wear. I find that this type of shoe is more comfortable if it is just a tad too big rather than too small. They are very comfortable and provide good support for my feet. I have plantar fasciitis and these definitely are very comfortable.

  With only whole sizes, many people will have a pair that's a little large or small. Their sizing info was accurate, so as expected, my pair are just a bit large. Perfect in this cool weather with some thick, comfy socks.In the summer, they were a bit loose with bare feet. Didn't fall off, though, so perfectly usable. The strap would keep them on, but I prefer slip on unless wading.

  Works for a quick slip-on for taking the dog outside. Easy to clean if you mistakenly step in something left behind by another dog in the dark (because yours would never do that to you).I would prefer if they had half sizes, or width selection, though. A 13.5/EE would probably fit perfectly, while this gives me a touch more front to back wiggle than I normally like.

  I typically buy size 12 US shoes I ordered an 11 in the crocs and they fit perfectly and after owning a pair of Indianapolis Colts crocs and wearing them daily for 10years as house shoes I know the fit will just improve and almost mold to my feet. my only complaint with the classic crocs is the sole can be very slippery on wet surfaces, the sell models with better soles but i couldnt find any with the vents like the classic.

",SH,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Not the best looking shoe, but great to wear around the house. These are great for shorter tasks such as taking out trash, light yard work, or a short walk. Provide for a more secure footing than flipflops and are reasonably comfortable. I wear 11.5 US and the size 12 Crocs fit perfect for me.

  I have plantar fasciitis, and these are one of the very few types of shoes I can wear all day. I teach high school and I'm on my feet all day, so that's saying something! I wore my first pair until I could feel small pebbles through the soles. Now I have three functioning pairs. I LOVE these shoes, and I really don't care how they look.

Comfy summer work shoes
",Stephanie C,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I work in the medical field, and normally wear danskos to work. Wanted to see if I could get something a little less hot for summer, so I gave these a try. I'm so glad I did, they are SOOO comfy! I would not wear them without socks, feel like that would end up pretty smelly after a few times wearing them like that. My favorite part of these are the ventilation holes - the AC in the car can actually cool my feet after a long day! I live in Phoenix, so that is actually a really big deal - I used to take my shoes off for the drive home to keep them from getting so hot, and you really aren't supposed to drive barefoot! The squishy foam is quite comfortable as well. Some flooring materials (laminate specifically) will make these squeak when walking, but not much different from my danskos honestly. They are totally silent on tile and linoleum. Wish I had bought these years ago for summers!

Crocs are an ideal solution, as they are easily washed, and have good traction on hardwood and tile floors.  Much more cost effective than the Birkenstocks I used to wear in the house.

  My crocs do not have a glamorous life.  They are barn and garden shoes.  They can be rinsed off easily and they do not slip on wet surfaces, well not until I have put a few years of wear on them and the soles go smooth. Yes I do clean the floor of my barn.  so they stand up to urine and feces.  When they do wear out, I buy a new pair.

Even the 10s were way too wide and would slip off my feet, however, so I returned them for this size 9. Now the length is a little cramped, but the width is still generous.

As comfy as they are ugly !
",Berta Dora,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I really like my clogs. I just don't like the way they look. And I wouldn't have considered them but I had to travel very light at some point and was jealous of a friend's clogs that served her well. The weight is amazingly low. So I tried them on and they are so comfy. First I didn't buy any because locally they are rather pricey but then I found them on amazon for a very reasonable price. I only wear them at home because I think they are really ugly but at home I wear them all the time. The are great for the garden because you can just hose them off if they get muddy. They are great for inside because they don't slip and the material warms up fast in the winter to keep my feet warm. The are treated with something antibacterial so they don't start to smell in the summer when your feet are sweaty. And they are made in Mexico which I prefer over made in China, for some reason including the short way to transport them. I like the strap in the back too. It is good if you have to walk further with them (which I usually don't but it is good to have options).

  Bought these for my husband to replace his 'ruby slippers,' after the Aussie-Collie pup chewed on them, like they were a toy! Imagine!  So- same great fit and function, just don't forget they will need a liner of some kind. Uh, the rubber-type liner was the FIRST thing the pup went after. (This time we tried Barney-Garnet.)

Read all of the reviews before your purchase.
",Paula,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  When I ordered these Crocs, I used the comments people had posted for getting the correct size.  I went the next size down because people were saying they were too big.  Sometimes it's a hit or miss with Crocs.  A blue pair I had purchased in a store were great.  I tried the same size in a black and they were too small.  Had to get a size up.  I can't understand why this happens.  Quality Control?

  I prefer Crocs to their $1 to $7 knock-offs. The patented Croslite material of Crocs conform to your feet after a day or two, and is much more durable than the material used in inexpensive knock-offs.Still, I wish Crocs weren't so much longer and wider than their stated size. The extra roomy fit can cause a lot of slippage when the Crocs get wet.

Excellent shoes. But I have a bunion
",Reid Thomas Piazza,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Excellent shoes. But I have a bunion, so sadly not wide enough  on my affected foot due to this, still deserve 5 stars based on passed experience. They last for ever ! And can go throw the washing machine. As a nurse theses are the best shoes I have had and they don't stink after a couple of months. The  little holes allow your feet to breath and cleared up my athletes foot. But one does need shoe cover with high risk patients with excessive body fluids !  Awesome for day to day use too. Can be slippery in wet weather when old and worn out

  The thing I love about these crocs is that they have these bumps in the sole which feels really nice on the foot! They’re easy to clean and easy to put on.

",Jeff,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I've owned several pairs of these.  They are comfortable, cool and provide good support. At least until they begin to wear out.  And the soles on these are pretty soft so they wear out fast.I like them and I buy them bit they make these in China for about $0.40.  They used to sell for $10.

:Love Crocs
",Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These Crocs work very well for me.  I work as a volunteer in a large hospital and they are the most comfortable shoe I have found.  They are light and easy to keep clean.  The only suggestion I have is I wish they were sized as my old Crocs are...Ladies 8-9, instead of a straight 8.  The combined size seemed just a little more comfortable.

Strap too tight.
",MM,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Only wear Crocs, due fibroid tumors on bottoms of feet. No other shoes are as comfortable. My only complaint is that the strap was too tight & too painful to wear as it forced my toes forward into the toe box of the shoes. Had to wear with strap up (doesn't feel quite as secure) most of the time & slowly wear with it on the heel to stretch the strap.

I can run outside in the morning in them, but they serve me mainly as a house shoe. Anyone who hasn't tried Crocs yet, especially anyone with foot problems, is really missing out!

The shoe for those who cares not about fashion
",crackergirl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I needed an all-purpose gardening shoe and ordered Crocs.  I haven't had any since their inception and had forgotten how comfortable they are.  They have become my shoe of choice to wear inside as well as out for working around the house.  I must, however, endure the comments about how nerdy they are from my children.  Now I'm buying a pair for my husband, so that he can be nerdy with me.

",Susan George,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  It was suggested by a friend that I get some crocs for my hubby to wear outside working in the yard, during his leisure time or camping.  I was skeptical as he is very picky about what goes on his feet.  Gave them to him for Christmas and he has been wearing them often.  Worked out great and he agrees they are real comfortable.  I already knew this as I own them in slip on and 4 pairs of Croc boots!!!

  This is my first pair. I bought them for Guam. People were wearing these all over Panama, so I figured I'd try them. I would pay twice as much for a half size, the 11 is a bit loose which is ok for sandals i suppose. Still, five stars for the price.

The fit is a good match with my regular shoe size, so buying them online is little risk.

* PERFECT SHOWER SHOES!
",Joe,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  When I deployed to Iraq back in 2008, I bought these to use as shower shoes.  They worked very well offering a decent grip on the shower floor.  I used them for an entire year while I was deployed and they held up great.  Not just in the shower trailers, but also when  walking on the desert ground that was super hot.  After using them in Iraq, I decided to just throw them out as I wasn't about to bring them home after using everyday in public showers.  Upon my return I bought another pair that I wear to go outside or down in my basement.  I give 4 stars only because the sizing is a little off.  I am a 9.5 so I ordered size 9 which was too small.  I returned that pair, with ease might I add thanks to Amazon free return, and ordered a size 10.  The size 10 is slightly too big but not to the point where it's annoyingly coming off my foot.  The back strap does the job in keeping them on my feet.I highly recommend these Crocs.  They are a perfect shower shoe due to the almost rubberish material.  They will not deteriorate.  Also great little slip on shoes for camping as well for treks to and from the community shower house.  Enjoy!

  I purchased the Crocs Classic to replace my 15 year old Crocs. I used my old Crocs exclusively for outdoor gardening. And they were still in good shape, but the light yellow color just showed too much dirt. I got the taupe color this time. Love these Crocs, even when my cement patio is wet, they do not slip. They help my gardening chores go much more quickly. They are so comfortable.

comfy but no traction
",emwall,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are super comfortable shoes and I use them all the time. The back strap on one of the shoes I received is too short to fit properly over the foot cover if you flip it forward rather than having it behind your heel.  This bothers me as I use these as outdoor shoes and leave the strap up so that I can slide them on and off easily.  I live abroad so it wasn't worth trying to return them.  The other downside is that they have no traction and slip easily on slick/wet surfaces.  I love them though, and use them all the time and would buy more in the future.

  Bought these on a one day deal....great price, less than $10.  Love Crocs. I usually wear 7 women’s in flats, so knowing these styles of crocs are a roomier fit, I ordered the 6. Fit is perfect. Love the pale pink color.

",Krystal Campbell,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are my first real pair of Crocs and I am pleasantly surprised how comfortable the insoles are - especially since years ago I tried a pair and didn't like the Crocs style insoles. After years of wearing Danskos, I decided to give the Crocs another try and am happy for it. I've always had knock-off Crocs that didn't have the insoles and now I understand (and feel) the difference. I have an office job, so I am not on my feet all day - I mainly wear these around the house or occasionally on the weekends.

",Noah,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Some folks in here complained that their Crocs seemed to be bad imitations, but these seem to be genuine Crocs, and they're great. I usually wear an 11.5 or 12 in most shoes, but I ordered 12s and they were way too big. The 11 fits fine, although it IS a bit wide. Maybe should have gone for the narrow, although I typically am a regular-width foot. Just some advice on the fit – I'm quite happy with these butt-ugly Crocs.

",Anabel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Man, I used to think crocs were one of the most hideous shoes ever (after Uggs, of course) but after owning mine for a few weeks, I have completely changed my mind. They are the only shoes I can be on my feet all day with and not feel any foot discomfort. It would be ideal if they were slip resistant, but I'll be okay. I think the fact that they are so comfy, easy to clean, and breathable has made them beautiful to me. I even wear them to go out, which I used to make fun of people for. Go ahead, make fun of me, but I am comfortable! :-)

  They have a bit of a funny shape at the toe, but they seem well constructed and are comfortable. They didn't have an 11.5, so I went with the 12 knowing it would be big, but it's a tad bit bigger than I thought. They still fit fine and since I am using them to walk across gravel to a shower in a war zone, they are easier to get on and off. Much better durability than my flip flops that fell apart.

  I love this Black pair simply because of the better fit compared to the Navy blue pair I have - both are the same size, made in Mexico, and ordered through Amazon just weeks apart. You wouldn't think a better fit would matter that much after all a Crocs is a Crocs is a Crocs. Frankly, I'm amazed that much that I'm gushing about it here. If I may say so, order these Black ones over Navy. You won't regret it.

",damasi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I purchased these to replace my fiancé's worn-out classic clogs. The reason they fit as expected is because I knew to get a smaller size this time. His shoe size is 10.5 and the old pair were 11's and quite large. Maybe because he doesn't use the heel strap? He prefers to flip it to the top of the clogs and wear them as a slip-ons. Went with a size 10 and they fit very nicely. 5 stars because he's so pleased to have a new pair of Crocs that actually fit.

Classics are the ONLY Crocs
",Will B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I've had 'em all and I keep returning to the Classic Crocs. Best shoe, despite any argument ANYONE has, I've ever owned. I have countless pair to the dismay of those around me... and I LOVE THEM.Since I like them so much here's some Crocs Classic info.They are great just about everywhere. I can accomplish just about every chore I do in them. They are worthless once they get water in them. (two pair and a towel nearby when gardening, really? ...hahah) So, they dry quickly.They aren't for bouldering or climbing trees but they can make it most places on a job site, trail walking, house and yard wearing.Classics are great because of the holes in the front for shaking out constant debris. Classics are affordable, but they all are relatively... these are just the best. More comfortable than the Rx pair, better than the rugged outdoor pair, night and day better than any of the fleece-lined winter ones. Get the Classics and forget the rest. ~ Cheers.

  I've been wearing crocs for years, starting with the original beach clogs and now the classic clogs.

  As with most flip-flops, for Crocs, women need to go a 1/2 size - 1 size down. I wear between a 7.5 and 8. I should have ordered a 7 and they would have fit fine. Would have done a quasi-even exchange -- another color, women's size 7. The orange is not as pictured. Kind of garish.

Comfort needs to be engineered back into the product
",Wilson Lee,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I bought these to replace a pair I bought 18 years ago. As others have noted, the current ""Classic"" model is made with a stiffer material than the original...this is absolutely correct. I prefer the softer original, but I'm pretty sure the copycats don't make the soft ones anymore, either. These are also slightly narrower, and the raised rubber nubs feel pointier (maybe because of the stiffer rubber?). Otherwise, these are almost identical to the 18 year old model. I usually like to buy products from the innovator, even if they're more expensive than the copycats, so I may buy these again in the future. On the other hand, the most desirable features have been pretty much designed out of the product, so, when it comes time to replace these, I may go with an entirely different product.

But these, for a size 12, were at LEAST two sizes two big, unless you're supposed to wear them with winter socks! Maybe I don't understand the style and they're supposed to be uncomfortably huge. I exchanged for a size 11 due to the fact that amazon's selection process for these is confusing and leaves much to be desired. However, after returning these and the size 11's I had to order size 10's from eBay. The return process was simple and I got 100% back, including shipping!Otherwise very comfortable.

Crocs around the house, with or without socks
",Wandering Philosopher,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I love Crocs, because they're easy to slip on and off, and because they're washable. I pretty much live in them around the house. Of course, I don't know whether or not they're somehow contributing to my back pain. And I think it probably took a while for me to learn to walk in them without tripping a little now and then -- there is a little extra length in them, but I think they are supposed to fit that way.This might be the most recent pair I bought, and it's almost two years old. I don't remember whether or not it was the case with them, but over the years I remember that on at least a couple of occasions new Crocs smelled when I first received them. Can't remember exactly, but it might be sort of a fruity smell. I don't *think* it washes out, at least not in one wash, but I think it dissipates over time. I think we used to leave them to air out for a while before wearing them. My sense of smell is sometimes annoyingly sensitive, so this might not pose a problem for the average person, especially if you keep your feet away from your (and anyone else's) nose.Roomy enough to wear with socks when my feet are cold, which is another reason to prefer them over my pink fabric slides. (Those are really awkward with socks).

",Professional Product Review Service,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Fit great!  I used my old pair so much for practically everything that they became 'outdoor' Crocs.  I ordered this pair for my 'indoor' Crocs.A few things I really like about them, and a slightly different perspective than the norm: I love them for playing drums!  Sometimes the kick drum beater swings back and hits the top of my foot, which hurts.  The layer of plastic 'armor' that the Crocs provide eliminates that pain.  The sole isn't too grippy and the shoes are very light weight, so switching between the hi-hat and second kick pedal is easy and comfortable, too.  Great for playing drums!

",rkb,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  After accidentally losing the nail on my big toe, the doctor recommended Crocs to protect my foot while allowing the wound to properly air. I borrowed a shoe from my housemate (one size too big) and ordered a pair for myself. I wear a 7 1/2 and the size 7 fits just fine. I am on my feet all day and this shoe allows my feet to breathe and keeps them comfortable. I think they will be my everyday shoe from now on- so much safer than the rubber thongs that were my habit. They are easy to rinse off after working in the yard and you can throw them in the dishwasher if you want to sanitize them. Ugly but smart!

This is THE most comfortable shoe that you can wear for this long
",J.Allen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I work in medicine and am on my feet 10-12 hours or more daily.  This is THE most comfortable shoe that you can wear for this long.  Athletic shoes have great support, but they strangle your feet and they suffocate.  These are FOAM shoes.  They are roomy and comfy and your feet breatheeeeeeeee. Other options are the Birkenstock clogs, but they are HEAVY as heck.  These are light as a feather.One thing to consider is where they are made.  I have had a few pairs of the same size and they all fit VERY VERY differently.  My previous pair was ""made in China"" and though they were size 8, they fit like a 9.  Too wide and too long.  I got used to them and used them for years.  These here IIRC are ""made in Mexico"" and they fit as a size 8 should.  At first I thought they were too small, but I was used to the ones that were too large. I read somewhere that different factories may have different molds for the same shoe.  It feels weird having ones that touch the sides of my feet, but they will break in and comform to my feet.  They are after all, foam.

Difficulty with Crocs' Online Sizing Tool
",NorCal Stu,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I've enjoyed Crocs for years -- tough, durable, water-proof, comfortable, even stylish. I've always purchased them in a store but ordered online just because I knew exactly what I wanted -- or thought I did until the pair I received through Amazon was a full size too big (even though the size imprinted in the shoe was identical to prior Crocs I've owned that fit well). The second (replacement) pair, sze 9M/11W, fit very well, even though I wear size 10M. As I noted upon returning the first pair, Crocs' sizing tool is not user-friendly and resulted, despite my best effort, in my having to return the first pair. Like most folks, I'm only going to re-order replacement shoes online if they are going to be VERY consistent in their size and width -- otherwise, I'll go to a store for the traditional try-on method of shopping. Since Crocs are not very expensive and available everywhere, I'm actually going to go to a store for try-ons in the future, even though Amazon's system for returns and replacing is excellent. Amazon did a great getting me the right size; my disappointment is with Crocs, who in my view make a great line of products but have a clunky and unreliable sizing system that, for me at least, made ordering online a disappointing experience.
