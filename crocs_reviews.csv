Not the good made in USA ones of years ago
",Outdoor Enthusiast!,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have worn Crocs for years, but the well-made ones that came from the USA (Colorado) many years ago.  These made in China ones are a harder plastic and extremely wide so that my feet slip around in them or the shoes fall off.  They also aren't anywhere near as comfortable due to the harder plastic, even if they did fit properly.  I have already started the return process, very disappointed since after many years, my American made ones are finally starting to wear out and need replacing

Two completely different sized shoes marked the same size
",MoMo Wondertoes,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  We have been buying crocs for a long time and this time we received crocs that were marked the right size .... but one was significantly smaller and more narrow than the other. This was something we only realized after leaving on vacation. Our 12 year old constantly complained that the one was too small and the other was too large. He had to wear them until we could find a store to buy him flip flops and so we couldn't return them by the time we got back as they had been worn. Not sure what happened here but I have them and they are definitely two different sizes...

",PJM,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I was hoping these would fit like the Classic Clog Crocs I already have but, they still feel too small.  It's the third pair I've ordered lately and can't seem to find the fit I was hoping for.  Ended up donating these and the others to Value Village since I had worn them a couple of times.  None of them seemed as roomy as the ones I have almost worn out.  I love Crocs but am frustrated trying to find the right fit!

crocs Unisex Classic Clog,Black,5 M US Men's / 7 M US Women's

  . I have worn a pair of Crocs clogs for over 10 years and decided it was time to replace them. The clogs now are nothing like the clogs of years ago. And sad to say the quality of what was a great buy is gone. This clog is now a plastic of some sort and the insole is not any more comfortable than a regular pair of shoes. I normally wear 6.5US and got a size 7. They are tight across the foot when using the strap, my foot is pushed forward and is uncomfortable. But without the strap the clog doesn't seem to fit right. Sorry to say I will not be buying Crocs clogs anymore.

",Amazon Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I bought these to replace an earlier pair which were just great, and which I wore for two years.  These were the exact same size and style as before (different colour only).I received these on October 4th, 2018.  Photo taken November 2nd, 2018.  That is less than a month.  You can draw your own conclusions from a glance at the photo.Also, this pair seemed smaller/tighter than the original pair, despite supposedly being the exact same size.  And the rivet/pivot on the strap raised a nasty blister on my foot.Will have to give serious thought before buying another pair of these!

Not a good Croc
",Kathleen Stewart,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are a cheap Crocs.  They have no arch support like the better Crocs do, the rubber is hard and not flexible and soft like other Crocs.  And they are much too large for a womens B width foot.  In fact, these Crocs actually hurt my feet and legs when I wore them out.  I will never wear these Crocs again.  In fact, I am taking them to Goodwill today and I just got them!I have 2 pairs of older Crocs that cured my Achilles tendinitis and plantar facshitis (spelling sorry), that mold to my feet and are so soft and cushiony and non slip.I think alot of what's wrong with these Crocs is the unisex thing.  I wouldn't buy them if I were you, you'll be sorry.

  Crocs has apparently decided to save money on materials by shrinking the shoes. These are a full 1/2 inch shorter and 3/8 inch narrower than the same size ones they were intended to replace. I have returned them. I'm hesitant to order a larger size as they are also narrower, so I guess after 15 years of wearing them, I will have to find another shoe.

  DO NOT buy these crocs if you are looking for the real deal, they are huge and the holes are the wrong size/ in the wrong places. They look fine on their own, but compared with real ones they are obviously fake. Spend the extra 5-10 dollars on real ones from the store or Crocs website.

",Judith E. Oakland,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I wish I had believed the comments about various size differences according to country of manufacture.  The Crocs I've always purchased in the past ran at least a size too large and very wide.  So, I ordered a size smaller than I usually wear; but the Croc slip-on I received is like a woman's size 8 regular (and I wear and 11 wide).  I can't even get my foot into it.  I guess I'll have to branch out to another brand of footwear that's more reliable.  I hate returning things and I usually just take the loss, but these are going back.

Uncomfortable
",Janet Mustain,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I got these because I wanted something that could get wet, without needing to dry forever like tennis shoes, for when I have to take the dogs for their morning walk, and still protect my toes and provide some arch support. I should never have bought them.First, if you have wide feet, just don't bother.  I ordered the Men's 9, because I wear an 11 Wide in Women's shoes.  HA!  These were barely long enough and tighter than any other man's shoe I've ever tried on before.  I wear men's tennis shoes because I have wide feet, but these shoes are very narrow for men's shoes.Second, your feet will sweat in these like crazy.  If you thought your feet sweat in your workout shoes, just wait till you wear these for a few minutes in the heat.  I have feet that sweat, not as bad as some people I know, but still, I like a shoe that breathes.Third, the little nubs that are supposed to keep your feet from slipping are very hard and unpleasant on the bottom of your feet and, even though this shoe runs small, your foot will slip around once it starts to sweat or gets wet.These are now shower shoes only, and that is a lot of money to spend on something you can only wear to take a shower.

Uncaring company!
",Kindle Customer,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I am very upset! I spent $45.00 purchasing these to wear a month!??!! The first time I cleaned them in hot, soapy water.....by morning when I put them on my feet, the left one had shrunk CONSIDERABLY. The right one only a little. Regardless, I cannot wear them now. The left foot is too short and it squeezes my foot as it became very narrow and snug!So be careful cleaning them. You may have regrets like myself! What a waste of my money!!!**ordered a second time because I loved the heel cushioning these offered up until the left foot shrunk. We shall see how the second pair work out. So far, so good but I haven't attempted to clean them either.  I will update after I do. I have to say I am absolutely DISGUSTED I have not heard from the seller! So even if this second pair works out, I will never give them more than one star. That is extremely poor customer relations. Obviously once they have your money, they could care less if you have an issue with your shoes.

  I have one pair of Crocs, ordered from Amazon in 2008.  This year, they got full of paint due to painting our house.  There still is nothing wrong with them other than the paint.  So, I decided to treat myself to a new pair.  The new ones are stiff, the nubs on the inside hurt and the toe box really wants to yank off my baby toenail, even though I trim them weekly.  Returning.  Way to screw up a great product, Crocs.  I soaked my old ones in soap and water overnight, dried them in the sun, stuffed newspaper inside and gave them 2 coats of Rustoleum flat black spray paint.  Viola!  Like new.  I am now a former Crocs customer.  The old ones fit like a glove and are the most comfy shoes I own.

Sizing Inconsistencies (maybe based on region of manufacture)
",Frank,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  This was my first pair of Crocs. I'm a men's size 8 in almost all brands of sneakers, so ordered my normal size. When these arrived, they were massive. My feet were swimming in them, and I could rattle them around by shaking my feet, heel straps engaged. But, I read that Crocs are supposed to be very loose, and just rolled with it. They never felt right, and so I decided to stop by a local Crocs store to make sure. The Crocs at the retail store in the same size/model were completely different. Since I had them both, I was able to compare and the Amazon ones felt and looked more like a size 9 or 10. I thought maybe they were fakes, but they were sold directly by Amazon and looked legit. The only difference I could tell was the retail store ones were made in Vietnam, whereas the Amazon ones were Brazil. So maybe they have very different injection molds at each location that cause for the size inconsistencies. Luckily, Amazon allowed me to return them and I bought a properly fitting size 8 pair of Crocs, made in Vietnam.

  Sigh, I expected to love these. My boys are so obsessed with their crocs that they practically live in them. My mother also insists they are the only shoe comfortable enough for all day wear for working on her feet all day. However, I immediately noticed how big they look. I slipped them on, hoping they would look less large, but no, they looked like little boats for my feet. I figured this would be ok, mostly wearing these for stream play, but they are constantly filling with sand and little pebbles. So of course, that is not a great quality in shoes dedicated to stream play. However, when I was brave enough to wear these ridiculous slippers out in public, the squeaked with every single step. Given their high price tag, I‚Äôm pretty disappointed.

Hideous Cheesy Feet
",Teacher/Business Owner,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I got these because someone recommended them for wearing around the house on our hard tile floors. We take off our outdoor shoes inside our home. Anyhow, they are the ugliest pair of shoes I have ever owned. They also make my feet look huge and wide. But that is ok since I got them to wear inside and not many people will see me in them. However, there is another problem. In spite of the holes, they get very hot and are not breathable. If you wear them without socks, your feet will get stinky sweaty. Lastly the arch support is ok, not as good as Birkenstock. The only good thing is they are soft and cushiony which I need walking around in hard tile. But other than that, I think they are no good and don‚Äôt understand the popularity. To me they are just overpriced made in china foam shoes. Nothing great. I wish I got a pair of EVA birkenstocks to wear around the house instead. Eva Birks are not as ugly, and have better arch support and nice cushion. Also price wise I think they are about the same. My Husband got the Birkenstock‚Äôs and I like his way way better. Also birks are made in Germany (not China like crocs) and they are better quality as a result.

Fatal Flaw - ‚ÄúMade In Mexico‚Äù - Raised Heel Strap Printing
",zride96,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have been buying Crocs for my son since he was old enough to walk. He‚Äôs always found them comfortable and we have gone through many pairs over the years. Now we just bought a new pair and they fit great with ONE BIG EXCEPTION. They are now ‚ÄúMade in Mexico‚Äù and they used raised printed lettering on the inside of the heel strap that is very uncomfortable. When my son pointed this out and how uncomfortable it would be I thought he was kidding. Sure enough I ran my fingers over it and yeah it would be very uncomfortable. Luckily I had his previous pair and was able to remove the heel strap, without any printing, and replace it on the new pair. Most people may not have this option so I would caution against buying these as I know it would rub against the skin and be very uncomfortable. Bad decision from the manufacturer! I hope this can be corrected ASAP. They almost were returned because of one seriously fatal flaw from the manufacturer.

The shoes were in an inner bag so I assumed they were okay, but they weren't...Didn't check the inside of the shoes before wearing - they are supposed to be new. Immediately after trying them on got a needle-like sharp pain in my toe and a black and blue swollen spot. (I didn't see the Recluse spider as they are very shy and inconspicuous and quickly disappear. (I have had these bites before and know what they are like). The pain kept coming back. Luckily I had a homeopathic salve and pills on hand. After applying the salve twice and taking the pills twice and sticking my foot in a cold compress, the pain subsided.The next day my toe is still swollen and a little sore...  Thanks for the envenomation, Amazon.Re the shoes: Love the color and ease of wearing. Love that it's waterproof. Got stuck in a rainstorm today - no problem. The only problem was the seller/packaging. I will only say this. Buy from a different vendor.

  The cut of these crocs is different than my older ones. It is very tight around the instep and cut is different on the heel. The material is much stiffer than my other crocs. Debating whether to order a larger size, or try to break them in. But the whole point of crocs is that they are roomy and require no break in time. What is going on with crocs now? Why are they shaped differently? I loved crocs and have a lot of foot issues so would like to find a solution.

  These crocs were exactly what I ordered and wanted for my daughter.

  Can't believe more people aren't complaining about the little bumps all over the sole of these shoes that stab me whenever I stand up, even when wearing socks. I'm a big guy, so maybe being heavier puts more pressure on my feet. But I'm probably gonna return these because I feel like I'm stepping on tiny rocks. Ok maybe not that bad, but it's not the comfort I'm looking for. Also, I have wide feet (4E) and usually buy a half size up when wides aren't available. But even a half side up, these are a little snug.On the positive side they look nice, seem to be decent quality, have good tread, breathable, everything that Crocs are known for.

  Not sure what the big deal is with these and why they have been so popular. In an effort to fit all, they are very wide and loose.

  I never have liked the looks of these butt ugly things but my podiatrist told me to get a pair because of a foot problem.  They do offer great support and curiousness for my poor broken foot.  I find that when I walk my heel tends to extend over the inner sides and wants to roll in.  This is because I have such a high instep that my foot does not go all the way in.  I have about an inch of room in front of my big toe and my heel actually sticks out the back a little.  Perhaps I should have gone with a larger size?  The construction of these shoes is great and they are comfortable.  I expect that I will continue to wear these around the house once my foot has healed because of the support they offer.  I like them as slippers but not for walking any distance.

  You expect good quality control from a brand name like Crocs so it‚Äôs disappointing to get one with obvious defects.

Not like my old Crocs
",Tripping Wisteria,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I bought my first pair of Crocs almost ten years ago, back when they were made in Colorado.  They were the most comfortable shoe for hanging around the house or cooking in the kitchen for long periods of time.  My house has tile or hardwood so there isn't a lot of give there.  Those Crocs were made out of a softer, squishier rubber that had a lot of give to it.  These Crocs are made of a firmer material that seems like it has some plastic in it.  They aren't very cushioned.  They are also a lot smaller.  They fit but just barely.  Don't know if that's because I got a pair from Mexico instead of China (and how weird is it to be hoping you get one of the ones from China but all the reviews agree they fit better than the ones from Mexico.)  Also these have anti-fatigue nubs inside.  They are arranged in ridges, higher in some parts than others.  You can see it's meant to be higher above the ball of your foot, under your toes but the weird sizing keeps my foot from fitting perfectly in that area so mostly I'm just walking on uneven nubs.  I don't know if they work for anti-fatigue because they hurt my feet and I can only wear these shoes for about an hour at a time.  I suppose it will be like when I was a kid in the summer and at first it hurt to go barefoot outside but after a while your feet toughen up and it stops hurting.  Not thrilled though to have paid money for shoes that my feet have to toughen up for.  They are also a lot hotter to wear than my old Crocs.  Not sure if it's because of the smaller size or the new material.  Overall, I'm very unhappy with these shoes.  Looks like I'll have to find a replacement for my old Crocs elsewhere.

They Work for What I Need, But They Seem Highly Overrated

  I bought these specifically for my rowing club needs. I needed something waterproof, easy to get on & off quickly, and the ability to stuff my foot into while wearing bulky wool socks (and, as I encountered the other day, the ability to actually float). They do provide for all of these needs. The fit, however, is a little weird. I'm a pretty solid Women's 7, with a fairly wide foot. The width is fine, but my toes hit the end of the shoe pretty aggressively without socks, and the toe grip thingy on the sole seems oddly placed.That said, I can see why some people think they're comfortable. But here are my top cons:They are terrible for gardening. If I'm walking on wet grass in the morning, my feet get wet. If I'm doing even light weeding, I get dirt stuck everywhere between the shoes and my feet.They are plastic and no matter how many holes you put in them, my feet sweat like crazy.They seem kind of expensive for plastic shoes.I think I'm going to stick to my FitFlops for life outside of rowing a boat.

Bought my first Crocs at a yardsale and they're wearing out so I ordered these which I believed to be the same thing, but they're absolutely not.  The bottoms of my old ones say ""W10-11  M8-9"".  These are ""M9 W11"" and the shoe is so big my foot is just rattling around in there.  They're going back, but I honestly don't know what size to order now.  My advice is to never buy shoes or hats on-line without free returns, and even then don't do it.

  I bought this for my daughter in her usual size for Christmas and it was WAY too big!

If she wasn't so excited about getting them (Her swim team wears them on the pool deck) I wouldn't buy her the new pair. I wish they offered an even exchange or explained that they didn't. Good product but bummed about being out an extra $16.

the mystery of Crocs
",Cristina,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I try these because I needed  garden shoes and since the black in my size was on sale I wanted to try for myself if they are really all that different of the cheaper copies.Well they are lighter than many I tried, but I got a pair when in Italy, brand named ""Woz!"" they are made of identical stuff.The list price on Croc side is $35 for these, I pay quite a bit  less here but I wonder how can some vendor ask close or more than 100 bucks for rubber shoes...This are garden clogs... maybe the brand has a kind of placebo effect or maybe my feet are not attuned to the different quality of rubber...One good thing, this design with the back strap, would make a better choice versus slides to use in the shower for an older person.

  This is the third pair of Crocs I have owned and I really like the fit and comfort and the protection over the toes but the previous two pair both shrunk several sizes when left out in the sun.  So much so that they were unwearable and had to be thrown away.  People have said they could be stretched out again with heat and water but I had no luck.

Issue with Amazon, moreso than the product
",Nick,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  The Crocs are shipped by Amazon in a bag. Because of this, anything on top of them are going to compress the shape. Clearly mine had been squished for quite some time, as the shape of the shoe opening is drastically creased. Stupidly, I figured this would reform over time... Instead I get blisters every time I wear them, so they're going to be donated. I'm a big fan of Crocs (mostly for the sex appeal), but I would never get them through Amazon again.IMPORTANT ALSO - The actual material itself feels much cheaper than the other crocs I own and purchased direct. Perhaps they are making an ""amazon"" version to keep up with demand? I'd highly recommend finding them elsewhere.

  In the ""how does this product fit?"" drop-down list, ""too narrow"" and ""not wide enough"" are not choices. CROCS come in MEDIUM. No AA, B, C, D, DD etc.I realize it is not a serious shoe like a Florsheim, a Rockport or a New Balance. But how about an a B, C and D at least.I loved CROCS till I got these. I have 2 pair that are at least five years old and half hundreds of thousands of miles on them---no tread so they are scary on wet roads, but still serviceable. Both pair are substantially wider than the new ones so I know CROCS weren't always just Medium. Just like I know that people are not all Medium. And that's really the issue in making a product.The CROC website says there are different widths: ""Roomy"", ""Relaxed"", and ""Standard."" You just can't get them. Amazon and Zappos and all other outlets have Medium. Which is a ""CROC.""

  This was my second attempt at getting a new pair of Crocs that fit. My shoe size is W6.5 so I bought the size W6 Crocs. When they arrived and I tried them on, they were too small. My toes were scrunched together and walking just a few steps was not comfortable at all. I returned them and ordered the next size up (W7), but they were still too small. I compared them next to the pair I currently have (size W6-7/S/M4-5, bought from a shop in Mexico) and you can immediately see the size difference (see attached photo). Haven't decided yet whether to go up the next 2 sizes or just go up 1 size at a time. I am able to return them for a full refund, so that's good. But seeing how much smaller they are, I might jump up to size 9 even though my shoe size has never been that big. If those fit me well, then I will change my rating to 5 stars, as I love my Crocs and wanted to replace them with ones I could wear outside (wore a hole through them that they are now inside shoes/slippers).

  I have worn crocs for years, never a problem. I ordered these and they came in and had the right size stamped on them so I tossed them into the closet since my old crocs were still hanging in there. Pulled them out yesterday and both shoes are too small despite the correct size (13) stamped on the bottom.  The left shoe is even smaller than the right one.  What a waste of time and money. I should have tried them on back then but with the correct size stamped on them it did not even occur to me. I have long ago tossed out the box. A waste of time and money. If you buy from this place then make sure you test out everything. Crocs are a very loose fitting casual shoe and I have never had one not fit. But live and learn.

  The baby blue color was pretty. I bought it in size 9B (W)/ 7 B(M). My daughter wears a size 7.5-8.0, and I am a size 8.5-9.0. The shoe was too long by a thumb and a quarter length for me and even longer for my daughter. I based the purchase on an older croc that was labeled 8-9 and which fit her just fine but touched my toe. I tend to like to purchase a half size up, so I ordered the 9. Because the length was too long, the ankle strap was useless. The width was too wide for my medium width feet and extra wide for my daughter's narrow feet. If you are a size 8.5-9.0 like me, I'd order a size 8. But beware that the width will still be big in general and especially for folks with narrow feet. The little nubs in the shoe were more pronounced in the toe area and hardly felt in the other areas of the shoe. I have flat feet, and the shoe did not have any arch support which works fine for me since my feet tend to hurt when shoes have significant arch support.

I'm disappointed that they don't fit like they used to. (My old pair, a Women's 7, that I have to throw out was much more comfortable.)  The way the straps are attached, they don't go all the way to the back of the shoe, so you are losing almost 3/4 of an inch.  If you use them like a clog, they fit okay.

  These are great shoes but if you order a men's size 11 what you get says size 11 but in reality it is really a size 10 so If I were you order the next size bigger, it will feel and fit better. I can wear the size 11 but without socks, not with socks too tight. It's time that shoe manufactures set a size standard on all shoes.

Returned first pair - Second Pair a little tight for a wide foot

  The first pair had the heel loop come off. The plastic part which secures the loop to the shoe came off. Luckily this was after just 5 minutes. Check this part first before wearing it outside. Other than that the second pair arrived and seems to work well. This are my first Crocs so we will see how much I like them as time goes by. Note - I usually wear a Wide shoe and the 11 M seem a bit tight when I wear socks. The similar Crocs offered on the Crocs website say that they are roomy, but I beg to differ and these same shoes don't seem to be.You might try a larger size if you have a wide foot. Note - if I don't wear socks the Crocs are fine - so I guess it depends on how you are going to wear these. If you plan to wear them with socks, get a larger size. On the beach, these would be perfect for me.

  Not sure what exactly happened, but I'll try to describe it. Sorry if it would sound weird :)So, first of all ‚àí I ordered Khaki, but received Black color. I actually didn't mind, because black was very good-looking, not dark-grayish, but really black, so I liked it.As for the size, here's where weirdness starts. I initially was happy with the size, it was even a tiny little bit larger than I wanted, but it's good with this type of footwear. Later I felt like it became fit exactly right, so I figured I just ""got used to it"". Then, after some time (I was happily wearing them for couple weeks, and really enjoyed them), I once found that I literally can't put them on: they are too small. I thought they just deformed a bit because of whatever -- salty ocean water, sun etc., and that they'll get back to normal soon. My wife half-jokingly said that my feet swelled :)Anyway, I tried to wear them for a minute, and it really hurt (I know, I shouldn't have, that was stupid, why would they become large again :)).Anyway, now they are even smaller, I can't even pretend I can put them on. I swear all my other shoes are fine, so my feet didn't swell :)I don't know if this all makes any sense, so I'm putting three stars as a neutral rating.

  Our family loves crocs and we have many pairs.  I assumed all crocs are made the same but for some reason these feel smaller and tighter than our other pairs.  Not sure if it is just an off thing or not.  Hopefully they will stretch.

Size Not Consistent with Previous Same Model
",John S.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I had an old pair of Crocs that were the same supposed size as the new pair I ordered (men's size 12). I have a wide foot and the old pair fit extremely well. This new pair (also men's size 12) are significantly smaller and narrower and barely fit my foot. I put the old pair up next to the new pair and confirmed that the new pair is, indeed, smaller and narrower.It's too bad that Crocs chose to change their sizing without letting their customers know. I'm not pleased with this purchase or with the company.

The bottoms were very smooth and comfortable, but for some reason one of the straps ...
",Welton E. Underwood,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have a pair of Crocs I bought at Dicks and wore them to and around Maui, Hawaii.  The bottoms were very smooth and comfortable, but for some reason one of the straps tore and came off so I ordered the pair I'm now wearing from Amazon and they are extremely uncomfortable with nibs so long on the insoles that they hurt and make my feet ache.  Being a diabetic I can't risk the crocs causing problem.  I wondered about the crocs so I took them to an actual croc store in Myrtle Beach and the sales lady assured me they were authentic saying that it depends on what country the crocs are made in as to how the nibs are on the insoles.  She suggested sanding off the nibs with sandpaper saying that is what her Dad did,  The Croc employee was so nice, helpful, and sweet especially when I fell in the store.  She only had one problem:  her name wasn't Amazon.  I wish I had sent the shoes back but for a swap-out but I didn't.  I hoped the nibs would wear down.  They haven't.  In researching this particular order, I discovered the straps on the new crocs are removable, so I am going to look at removing them and placing them on my original pair of crocs.  Croc Corporate is trying to help me and they have been extremely nice just like the Amazon employees with whom I have dealt.  I  guess I am just a balding, fat, Southern old coot who is too set in his ways about what he likes or doesn't.  I look at my wife of 35 years and then at Amazon.  If I was told I had to make a choice between the two, well I just I hope Amazon will be real understanding when I park my motorhome in their parking lot.  Love the place.

Hard, uncomfortable, small.
",Taylor Hastings,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Okay, I just got my first real pair of crocs.  I've been wearing knock-offs for years and have been trying to find more of that brand, but to no avail, so I went with the crocs.  They are rock hard and the soles have little tiny spikes that are not so pleasant!  I wear size 7 1/2, but decided I wanted them a little roomy, so I went with size 8-9 and was surprised that my feet barely fit in them.  I'm dearly hoping they break in because they are really hard and tight on the top.  At least they are super wide (and I have REALLY wide feet, so that's saying a lot!).  Just had to put in my two cents.

  There's something about these Crocs that are just different than the pair I had a few years ago. It might be the little knobs in the footbed or something, but they're just not as comfortable out of the package like my first pair. Plus, they're just slightly more narrow. Not so much that it's a problem, and they do give more with time, but it's noticeable. At least to me. I'd probably give this more like 3.5/5 than a 3.

",Public buyer.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  It seems that the size and toe space is different depending on where the Crocs were produced. The ones from Mexico seem to run smaller with a narrower toe space than the ones from China. This makes it difficult to order because it is not clear as to where the product being sent to me is from, Why should there be a difference in size for the ""same"" shoe? Are the templates used different in different countries. It may need to be stated in the order guide where the product being sent is from, or it would be best if the buyer of the product can choose the manufacturer of the Croc. All of this is moot if there is still a difference in fit between the same products from the same country much less from Mexico vs China. That's why it is so confusing when I read the critiques of the product where some one would say the size is 1/2 to 1 size larger than stated and someone else says it is 1 to 1/2 size too small. The comparison must also state whether they were discussing a Croc produced in China vs Mexico or where ever.

  The sizing on Crocs seems rather variable. Makes it hard to shop them.Also, I once read an article that many cheap shoes and not so cheap shoes are being manufactured with toxic plastics. The key to knowing if they are toxic is a sweet odor emanating from the product. Sadly, this pair had a pungent sweet smell. It's not only the gases which can be harmful to the nose and lungs etc, but also making contact with bare feet is undesirable.

Beware of ladies' vs. Unisex sizing!
",Sharon M.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Based on a previously purchased pair similar (but without backstrap) that were a bit snug at the end of the day or on ""swollen feet"" days, I purchased this, only one size larger. Mistake.  I am SWIMMING in these. I might try them in the fall with socks, but that defeats the purpose of easy rinse off with hose through the holes.  Moreover, since most gardening is done with water, I'll be left with wet, dirty socks each time.  Beware of the difference between ladies', men's, and unisex products.  My former purchase must have been a ladies' shoe (didn't buy online, and there's no indication inside or underneath shoe, just a size number), and these are unisex.  Bottomline, if basing new purchase size on a current pair of shoes, know that unisex is like TWO sizes larger than a current ladies' size.  It would be nice, also, if Crocs would 1.) consider labeling the bottom of their shoes with an L, U, or MN (not just M, or people might think ""medium"" who didn't know better) before the size number (for ladies, uni, or men) so that  future customers (and current! esp. if received as a gift) know what they own, and equally important, 2.) state how to convert various gender sizing with ordering similar or same shoes--example ""Order same size if you want a slightly larger fit, when going from ladies' to unisex.""

inferior product
",Tara,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I read a lot of reviews here before purchasing the crocs. My boyfriend has crocs that I slip on and we both love them so had better get my own! His are comfortable and made in china. Many reviews said the mexican manufactured croc offered less cush, uneven heel straps, and pretend nubs on the footbed. Reviews compared this shoe to the chinese manufactured croc, which was more cushion-y, had even heel straps, and nice nubs on the footbed.Amazon claimed their crocs were Origin: China ( I cut and pasted the last two words from the description of the product in ""my orders"" section of their website.) I was disappointed when the crocs arrived. The heel straps were even with each other, but at least a half inch shorter than the shoe. The aren't cushion-y at all. The footbed nubs are more like a design. They aren't comfortable, at all, and the heel strap is unusable because it makes the shoe much too small.I wouldn't have bought the shoe knowing it would be from mexico, given the reviews. Apparently they have free returns on some products but it is hard to find if this shoe is one of them. If its not the return cost is half the price of the shoe, so I'm stuck with a mislabeled inferior product.And they aren't even comfortable! So what's the point?In addition, there was trouble with the shipping of this product and two others I ordered at the same time. I've been wasting my time on the phone with generally unhelpful amazon reps for the last three days. The man I spoke with today was extremely helpful, and when I mentioned this to him, he said on the fourth call Amazon directs the caller to a Senior Agent, (aka someone who is helpful) but the calls prior will be directed to someone who is not a senior agent (aka someone who is not helpful). I am always curious to know the whereabouts of the call center, and I feel intrusive asking, but I did ask this time, and the man was in Costa Rica. I'm pretty sure the guy I spoke with yesterday was in India, and I would love to know how many american cents amazon pays him a week. He could be helpful, but he has a lot of ""Amazon policies"" to stick to which prevented us from getting anywhere.Amazon has lost my favor. We had a good run, though.

",HOWIE O,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  My first pair of Crocks and it will probably be my last.  Wider than most medium sized shoes. Length is ok.  Don't stay on very well without the heel strap which is not adjustable.  Overpriced for what you are getting.

Sizing is an issue
",Chloe Pham,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I love these shoes they are very comfortable but the sizes frustrate me. If you are a half size, sizing down will allow the shoe to only fit without the back strap on and if you size up the shoe will fit only with the back strap on.

Don't ever buy unisex Crocs for myself
",Cynthia,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These unisex shoes don't fit, and I've been trying forever to get a label to send them. I can't because I made a mistake with the white ones(too big) and spent forever trying to get the correct mail label for the black Crocs. What must I say or do to get the RIGHT LABEL? I live 50 miles from the UPS Store. It's not in Washington,NC as your employees INSIST that it is. There's a Mailbox store without the capabilities to aid Amazon's technological way of accepting returns.

Imported just not the same...
",misselaines25,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I'm so disappointed with Crocs - these I got are made in Mexico, and they're so different from my favorites, which were made in Colorado. Those were (and still are, after many years) soft and comfortable. Because of the reviews, I ordered up a size, and they're HUGE. Because I'd thrown away the wrapping, I won't return them, and I might order a smaller size, just to see. But they're hard and shiny - not at all what I want...at least the back straps seem to be the same length, unlike others that were reviewed. I ordered online because the stores are full of other styles that also just don't fit the same. Very frustrating...

  There is no longer any uniformity in Crocs Classics.  I have several pairs of Crocs Classics in size 11W/9M which fit fine.  I recently ordered two additional pairs in the same size, and they are markedly smaller - close to a full size smaller - though they are marked as 11W/9M.  All pairs were made in Mexico, so it is not like different molds in different countries.  There is simply no consistency, and my tendency now would be to NOT buy Crocs online from Amazon or any other retailer but to buy them in a store where I can try them on before buying.

Shrinking crocs
",E. J. Dutton,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Until a couple of weeks ago, I would have given these shoes 4 or 5 stars. However, I found out that if you leave them out in the sun (on a deck, for example), they *shrink*! I can't wear the pair I bought in December, as they no longer fit on my feet. I bought another pair earlier, and loved them. The tread on the bottom had worn down after a couple of years of hard use, so I replaced them with the exact same item. I will still replace this pair with the same thing again, but I certainly will not leave them on the deck when I bring my dogs back in the house..

",Firefly,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I was disappointed in the fit. actually too wide and a little short. I ordered my usual shoe size. Out of three different Croc shoes that I have purchased recently, this was the worst fit. It would help a lot if when ordering, there was more to go on to select a proper fit. Then there is the chance that you did not get the same manufactured shoe as was described. From reading other comments, I feel that my experience in buying  Croc shoe is very similar. Thus my three stars. I love a Croc, when it fits as described. I feel that I will no longer participate in this Croc hunting game in the future. I, unfortunately, do not live near any Croc shoe stores.

The Mysterious Sizing of Crocs
",Casey Y.,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Purchased the silver Croc and fell in love with them (did not see that coming!).  Sprained my ankle pretty badly a few days later and fortunately had these which were the only shoe I could wear with all the tape and the ankle brace. (Felt fairly stable, too!) Decided to buy some more, so got the khaki. Weirdly tho, the khaki are the same size (per the chart, 10""=9 women)...BUT, the size label on the new package had ""roomy"" on the size label and the Croc is way larger than the same-sized silver purchased before and had fit just dandy. As I pointed out to Amazon, the ""roomy"" designation's explanation was nowhere to be found in the description on the web page. Of course (and I may yet do exactly this), I can keep ordering them and hoping I will get a non-""roomy"" shoe.  But, it does seem a whole lot messier (more work and time) than the seller being clear about the sizes or at least noting that some of the sizes come ""roomy"".  Why was there no description on ANY of the Croc shoes I looked at (studied the size chart on every Croc I looked at, so that wasn't the problem) delineating the ""roomy"" sizing.  It just seems to be common sense.  I know nothing else sized this way and am glad for that.  Imagine a dress or pants that come in a size 9 and a size 9 roomy, but you can't know by the description...  I mean, even then there's designations like ""relaxed fit"" so you are aware of the difference.

no longer Made in USA - Made in China!
",T. E. Mo,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  The cayman i received fits fine and works fine.  The details of the moldings, however, were noticeably less defined than the ones i bought last year.  Upon closer examination, i noticed that the words MADE IN USA imprinted on the underside of the crocs on last year's model were replaced with MADE IN CHINA on this year's model.  Perhaps THAT explains the lacking quality difference?  Again it still works fine, but SORRY!  I'm not paying $30 for crocs MADE IN CHINA that look like the cheaper chinese-made knock-offs!  For those, the only things lacking are the cute little croc buttons on the sides.  I'll buy other brands (albeit made in china) for a lot less.

  Too bad this Croc is sized incorrectly.  I usually wear a size 14 shoe.  While at a local Big 5 I tryed on a size 13 and found that it was too small.  (It was worth a try)  I was excited to find this size 14 on Amazon.  Upon receiving the Crocs I found that they were marked as 14, but were several sizes too big.  I could have left my shoes on and put them inside the Croc.  When I used the printed the return label through Amazon I found that I had to pay the shipping to return them.  I contacted the seller, Surf and Dirt.com, and talked to a helpful customer service rep.  He told me that I would have to ship the item back at my cost and then after examination they would make a determination of whether they would pay shipping.To follow up:  I returned the sandals which were inspected by Surf and Dirt and my money was promptly refunded for the item and delivery.  For customer service I would give a 5.  Unfortunatly the product was way off the mark.

  Inconsistent sizing, at least on those made in Mexico. We were looking for next size up to replace previous pair for a fast-growing teen. The size W9/M7 is identical to W8/M6, both made in Mexico, with the strap being shorter than before. Inconsistent sizing makes it virtually impossible to buy online. This model is called Classic and is supposed to substitute for Cayman, but the sizing is all wrong. The ones made in China seem to run larger, but you do not know the origin of the pair that will be shipped.The actual Crocs store might be currently the best option for proper sizing, unfortunately.

This is the first time I have written a review and the only time I have not been happy with an Amazon product and I make a lot of purchases on Amazon.  Stuffing the inside of the Crock to keep its shape would have made a difference.

I needed a size, 11 men! unfortunately, the product comes from overseas so to return it it would have cost me more than 2x the original price!

Order smaller than your actual shoe size!
",Jacob Beaumont,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Ordered these just as a little joke, but I have worn them multiple times because they are very comfy. Unfortunately the sizes either run big, or I just ordered wrong. I ordered a size 10 and they are very, very big on me but the strap on the back does help hold them on pretty well which is the only reason i did not return them and exchange them with a different size. If you want to order these and are not sure what size to get, an example of my shoe sizes might help. I wear a mens 9 in converse, mens 9.5 in adidas, and mens 10 in vans. Hopefully that helps you understand what size to purchase.

  Unfortunately these don't fit my feet and I'll be returning them. I think the problem is that they are a Unisex style which may be wider than a normal ladies medium would be. Also, when trying to use the strap to keep them on my feet, my toes were shoved into the toe of the shoe which was painful when trying to walk.Other friends and family members love their Crocs, I'm just the unlucky one.

The pair I just received are at least two sizes too big, despite being the 'correct' size I've ordered previously.  They also feel completely different.  Where all of my previous Crocs feel like rubber/foam, these feel like slippery plastic.These also appear to have been made in Mexico, whereas my other pairs have Made in Italy on the bottom.  Perhaps that's the difference, they are clearly different and that's unfortunate.

I'm wearing them for yard work, as I did my old pair, but not sure if that's a great idea, given that they are a little small.

The pair I got, the heel on the shoe is misshapen/deformed and the support band is quite a bit shorter/tighter on that same shoe, making it a bit uncomfortable. The other pair I purchased was not bagged or on a hanger and had scuffs all over, possibly a return.

",Matthew W Shepherd,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Well, I wear a men's 7.5, so I ordered an 8 because of how large the fit is, as per reviews. My foot slides around in them when I walk. I couldn't imagine wearing them working in the garden. Way too big. Why can't crocs just come in the proper size like other shoes?

Satisfied, not ecstatic, but I'll continue to buy/wear out of loyalty.
",Andrew,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I started wearing Crocs when I began college in Boulder, CO, which is the birthplace of Crocs.  I'll continue to wear Crocs out of loyalty, but I'm not  ecstatic about these ""classic"" Crocs.  I put classic in quotation marks, because Crocs loyalists know that they were once made in the USA, and the shoes that were made in the USA were sized in ranges and were made of superior material that was a tad bit softer.  Please know that I'm traditionally not a hooah-hooah ""Made in the USA"" minion, but there are distinct differences between the USA- and Mexican-made Crocs.  Crocs made in Mexico are made of a similar (but different) material that has a slippery finish, and they are sized in whole-sizes only.  I resisted buying Mexican Crocs because of these material and fit factors, and so I wore down my USA Crocs to the end.I wear a 10.5 running show, and in the USA size Crocs I wore men's XL (10-11), which were perfect!  For the Mexican Crocs I ordered M11, but they were too large: too much play in the toes and too much length between the heel of the shoe and the heel of the foot.  I returned them for Mexican M10, which is what I settled on.  They're good with room in the toe, but I would have liked an extra half-inch on the heel.  This is why the USA sizing scheme was better FOR ME.  I acknowledge all feet are different.Some will say that the changes in workmanship came after the supposed slit of the company's founders due to a nasty divorce.  Search for that on the internet and decide for yourself.Props to Amazon for the consistent Prime service, and this was the first purchased I used the Amazon Locker feature, and that went well.  I appreciated this because I did Airbnb, and I didn't feel comfortable having a package delivered there.

That was a deal breaker for me (thankfully Amazon has a free return option!)Also - they felt somewhat large lengthwise (I'm normally 12 / 12.5 so I figured 12 would be on a smaller size but that was not the case).Finally - I didn't like the overall loose fit (I guess some would call it ""comfortable"" but I wouldn't dare to step outside in them; definitely couldn't run in them or even walk fast).Note for reference - I'm not a sandal / flip-flop, etc. person - I always wear regular, closed, well-fitting shoes.

Great for the yard, But do not leave out in the sun...
",Boston Audiophile,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are what you expect; waterproof, easy to clean and pretty darn comfortable. Great for yard work, gardening and for slipping on and off when you need quick foot ware. In other words, shoes when you're too lazy to put on regular shoes. Better than flip flops when you need some tootsie protection.My only complaint is if you leave these in the sun they will shrink considerably. I left mine on the back stoop where they get direct sun in the afternoon. The rubber shrank a full size smaller so they no longer fit. I live in Massachusetts where the sun isn't intense. But apparently afternoon UV exposure is enough to cook your Crocs. I have never seen this happen with flip flops that I have left outside. It's disappointing Crocs wouldn't have this figured out (i.e. UV resistant rubber, etc.) especially given their practical use in the yard.

  I wish wide sizes were available. If your feet are at all wide these will become uncomfortable really quick. I read about a trick, where you put on several pairs of thick socks, put these shoes in a hot dryer for a couple minutes, then force them on your feet to widen them a bit. It seemed to help a little, I suppose. Wish they had wide sizes available, otherwise the shoes are same quality as all Crocs, just OK.

",DJ,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  love this clunky little things, however, the fit is SO difficult. Have several different styles and as many of the reviews say, there is MUCH variance in the fit. While the length of these is accurate 7W/5M (I wear 6.5 normally) they are SO huge, I would need a couple of pairs of socks to keep them on. Returning.

Classic crocs still classic but sizing unpredictable.
",Sherry G.,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have been wearing crocs for years, and these were just as expected except for the size.  Buyers beware.  I ordered the same size and style of unisex classic  crocs as my old ones.  They were significantly shorter.  Exchanged to the next size up, and they were identical to the old ones.  I could not have been mistaken because the size was still visible imprinted on the bottom of the old shoes.  I would give them 5 stars because I like crocs, but feel forced to downgrade because of size inconsistency.  How hard can it be to make a molded shoe conform to size?

Cute shoes.  But too small or too large if you're a true half size!
",Abbott,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I bought a size 9 (women) since I wear a 9 in a sandal.  I wear a 9.5 in a closed toe shoe.  But there was a recommendation in this description that half sizes should order down.  So I thought a size 9 would be just right for me.  Alas, they are too short.  The end of my toes touches the front of the shoe even without a sock.  So I immediately had to put them back in the box and return them.  According to my experience, one would order a size up, not a size down.  A 9 is too short for a 9.5 foot.  Still, they are very nice and attractive shoes, so I'm ordering a size 10.  I'm giving 5 stars because there was nothing wrong with the shoes, just bought the wrong size and don't think the description should have suggested ordering a size down.Update:  I have to change my rating from a 5 star to a 2 star for the simple reason that they will not work for someone like me with exactly 1/2 size off.  After the above-described experience (ordering a size 9 women for my 9.5 foot), I sent them back and ordered a size 10 women.  They are enormous.  I can't possibly wear them even with a very thick sock.  They fit me like boats.  I really wanted to like these, and except for their being a smidgeon too small in size 9, I really would have liked them.  I guess I have to give up on Crocs.  I would guess there are a lot of people like me in between sizes who can't make them work.  Much of the problem might be that when the size gets larger, both the length and the width increase.  I didn't need them any wider at all, just a tiny bit longer.  Too bad.

Disappointed!
",Martha,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These new Crocs are not as good as my old ones. I've bought Crocs for years, as gifts too. When mine finally got holes in the soles, I wanted a new pair after so many years. Looked at the new styles, but reviews said the fit was off, so decided to stay with the tried and true. The good old Croc!Well, NOT!  This is an imitation of what used to be. There is no arch support on the inner side which my old ones had. The bumps on the soles are hard and not comfortable at all. The only good thing going for this pair is that the heel support is still very good. I use them for walking the dogs rather than putting on socks and sneakers. But this pair has already given me a blister where the top rubbed my skin.Bad buy. Get a cheap pair someplace and put inserts in, then you may be able to walk in them.

There is a severe size distortion between the M7 and M8 sizes; the former is far too short and the latter is far too long for my foot.  The M7 is three times longer than the average difference between sizes!  Dear Crocs: please fix your quality control program!1. My shoe size is US 8 ¬Ω or 9 ‚Äì none of these Crocs sizes approximate a normal US shoe size.2. I ordered three pair in order to find the right fit.  None fit!  I compared these three sizes (all made in Mexico), with my wife‚Äôs  (made in Italy).  The current old pair that I wear, which fit perfectly, are ‚ÄúM6/7.‚Äù  The length differences between the four new pair is telling: M5 to M6*:0.3cm; M6* to M7: 0.7cm; M7 to M8: 1.7cm; M8 to M9: 0.3cma. M5 (Italy) 25.4cm (9 7/8in) long, 10.7cm (4 3/16in) wideb. M7 (Mexico) 26.7cm (10 1/2in) long, 10.7cm (4 1/4in) widec. M8 (Mexico) 28.4cm (11 1/8in) long, 11.2cm (4 3/8in) wided.

Comfortable but really hot

  I told myself I would never buy this style of Croc, but I figure as a house shoe, I could make an exception.  I have hard wood floors and am super pregnant, so every step was beginning to really hurt.  I've heard good things about these, so I bought the cheapest color in size huge because my feet are in fact, huge.  They fit fine and have definitely eliminated a lot of my foot pain, however, my feet are sitting in a sauna.  I have to wear socks with them and I still have super sweaty (and not to mention, stinky) feet. I'm not one to have ever had a sweaty or stinky foot issue, but in these I'm queen gross foot.  I knew this would be an issue to an extent, but wow, this is ridiculous.  I'll switch between these and my gel flip flops (which don't do much for me) throughout the day, just to give my feet a breather.  Are they comfortable?  Yes.  Would I have bought them if I knew how my feet would handle this material?  Nah.

  I have not found these sandals as comfortable as most people profess--especially at the price. I have a pair of take-off crocs I got at a discount store, and they have a softer sole, which makes them more comfortable.  I do have narrow feet, which may be a factor.  The Caymans are narrower than the Beach sandal and they do clean up nicely, but my feet swim in them, and I have worn them for a while now, and they do not seem to be conforming to my feet, as I thought they might.  In sum, if you have narrow feet and are seeking a softer shoe, you may not care for these.

  I bought crocs Men's 12132 Classic and returned them, buying this unisex classic instead.  The 12132 were made in China while these ones are made in Mexico.  I feel and see the difference in quality; the Mexican clogs feel a lot cheaper as though made from a lower quality plastic.  We'll see how long they last.

Lousy quality control on fitment, 10 to big, 9 way small.  Thats just nuts.
",Charles Hugh,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  never liked to look but bought a pair of cheapo knockoffs and wear them around the house, they walk great but the knockoff plastic in the upper is a little stiff so ordered the real deal  based on reviews.  Cost 5 times more money in the local store, about 35% less on AMZ.  The knockoffs are a US Mens 10 so ordered mens 10.  Well, they were so large they would not stay on.  Plastic is much more supple so I was sold on going with the Crocs.  Went to local store and tried mens 9 which felt fine so sent 10s back and ordered  a 9 but they are very small. Fit more like an 8 shoe.  They are so small my toes dig into the front.  So sending those back.  Great for walking and comfortable but even though they are obviously molded in one piece there must be differences from machine to machine, plant to plant or something.  I read that these will shrink in sunlight perhaps the 9s were sitting around a while an shrank?  Very disappointed and now another return back to Amazon.  Seems I'll have to go local to find a pair to fit.

Too Small
",Lisa Vouk,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I was disappointed with these crocs. I have bought them on Amazon before, but those actually fit me. These were too small, they seemed at least one size too small. I tend to round up a size with crocs anyway because they often run a little small. I compared these to a pair of size 10 crocs I already own, and they were significantly shorter in length. I was very unhappy with this purchase. From now on, I will now be buying my crocs in store, not online.

  I ordered a 11W/9M in size and gave this as a gift. Unfortunatley, the crocs were in a bag and I didn't take them out to make sure the size was correct, because I assumed I had been sent what I ordered. I was called a day later by the recipient and told that the size was wrong (I had been shipped was a 12W/10M, which was WAY too big!)  It is clearly marked on the bottom of the shoe, and I am so disappointed in Amazon for shipping me the wrong size.  The recipient had really needed these shoes, and rather than mess with a return, I had to go to a store to buy them, which put me out double the cost.  Don't order these online through Amazon--you don't know what size you'll get.

  Crocs have a very generous fit - so a wide shoe is to be expected.  The strap broke off the Crocs right away.  The shoes are getting returned.

Well, I bought a pair of real Crocs & used them on my kayak, but a month or so into the summer they had shrunk immensely (I‚Äôm talking several sizes).  Ok, maybe I just bought some from a bad batch, so I got on Amazon & bought another pair (a size too big in case they shrunk a little & white to lessen the heating). Well, they also shrunk down to the point where they are getting uncomfortable.  They are nice-looking shoes, but are just not usable for outdoors. Guess it‚Äôs back to Walmart for a pair of knockoffs. Really disappointed.

Before I even put them on I noticed they looked smaller, so I checked the size, which was right according to my old pair but they were significantly smaller.  Now I have a pair of Crocs I can't wear.  Definitely try them on before you detag them to make sure they will fit  the way you are expecting.

  I live in Crocs. They are the only shoes that I can wear and don't go to bed with so much foot pain I can't sleep. However, every time I order Crocs from Amazon, I fall for the sizing chart. It said if my foot measured 10 inches, heel to toes, I needed a women's size 9. Will my foot is exactly 10 inches and the size 9 ladies is way too big. I had to return them and ordered the size I have been wearing which is a 7. Next time I'll just order the 7 and forget about the inch measurement.

",Kimberlea Thompson,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These Crocs are one size too big, very inconsistent sizing.  Such a hassle to send back and then re-order a size smaller.  Usually ordering on Amazon is so convenient, but they wont accept a replacement since there was nothing (physically) wrong with the shoes.  So now they must be shipped back and I must place a separate order for the smaller size.  This is one example where going to a store would have been a better choice.

Sorry system for sizing on this description
",Ravenhill,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  If sizing on the order screen and description matched exactly what is on the shoes, it would help. I love the shoe, and the low stars are about ordering from this Amazon seller.The shoe itself reads M5 W7 has a tag that says ""M5/W7"" and is clearly labeled Made in Mexico. I'm returning them for another size up, hoping I don't get US sized ones which will then be too big.I've worn Crocs for years, and the way sizes were listed on this item description was confusing, as it did not match the ones I was wearing when I tried to place the order - which were made in the US - read ""W 8-9 M 6-7"". These were not an option. As a result, after measuring my foot, using the chart Crocs provides, etc etc I have a pair that is too small. I put a lot of thought into it and did not just push a random button.Ideally, the top and sides should not touch your foot when you are standing. They are supposed to fit that way....and so if you find them hot, it may be you are not in a large enough size.Annoyed that I now have a wait for the right shoe. Wish the brand would standardize the way shoes are labeled and that people selling it would then follow that method...and not lie about where the shoes are made, as in putting US in the title.

And that's true of this one, the Classic clog, so order down a half-size if your normal size happens to be one that Crocs doesn't make.It's important 'NOT' to overestimate which size you'll need is because the strap at the back will fall down if they're too large, causing your shoes to fall off, thus being essentially unwearable.LATE EDIT: After a month of wear, I decided to revisit my review. Part of my reason for reexamining my initial review is a change I've noticed is the rubberiness or softness of the material now used in my Crocs clogs. Besides their (apparent) tendency to wear out quicker, I now have problems with stability in them, which is a very important issue for me because of health issues.In all fairness, I have other Crocs, some sandals, which aren't composed of such soft material, but I'm not trying to analyze the decision-making process that led to the change. However the change came about, the newer clogs are now made of a poorer quality material. Moreover, the issue of stability is something I've monitored because of its importance to me. I've been chastened in my past experiences with Croc imitators, only to go back to Crocs once again. And now I find myself having to look elsewhere once more.

Comfortable, ugly shoes!
",Carmen Durango,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Man, I feel like these shoes are just so ugly.  But I got them because I needed something to wear around the house and yard that was supportive to my feet, and these are all that.  They are also pretty easy to clean with the hose, which is good in case I accidentally step in a doggy 'landmine'.  I have to say tho, that the look is just really hard for me to get over.  But if that is a concern, you can do as I do and stick to wearing them only at home.

  These are made in MEXICO.... do not buy! I have a pair of Crocs, that I still wear, that are 10 years old. They are soft, thick, rubber, and very roomy. They are a size 7. I purchased these in a size 7 and my heel hung off the back. I thought they might have been marked wrong on the size so I returned them and ordered another pair, same thing. They are a full size too small, and very hard rubber. Go to a Crocs store if you want real MADE IN THE USA Crocs that last forever.

Don't leave them in the sun they will shrink!
",River13,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have owned a pair of crocs for about 8 years and wanted a new style so I bought these. The old ones was made in China and the rubber is a lot different than the new crocs that are made now in Mexico. If you leave these crocs in the sun they will shrink a size down. My old crocs I store them on my back porch and they get full sun and have never shrunk. I left these new ones from Mexico in the sun for only a few hours and they are at lease 1/2 size smaller now. My big toe hits the end now as before it didn't. My husband bought a new pair last year and told me they are a lot different than our old pairs and he swore they shrunk when he left them outside but I didn't listen and when I got my new pair it did the same thing. The rubber on the Mexico one's is like a shiny rubber as the old one's from China is a dull rubber. The China ones seems a little thicker also. I don't know why the company started using Mexico to make them but I wished they would go back to China because the old ones are a lot better. I went to a store that sells them and checked them all and they are all made in Mexico. I think the old ones are more comfortable also.

  Crocs aren't cheap footwear anymore. They're still fine for everything but wearing to the office, but with ""Made in China"" on the bottom, I would think they'd be about half the price. Maybe we'll be making our own with 3-D printers some day.

  I've worn CROCS for years and have loved every pair...until now. CROCS quality has gone down hill. This pair was made in Mexico, and is sized much smaller and tighter than my previous CROCS which were made in China. Even at a reduced price, they weren't worth the cost. They rubbed uncomfortably across my arches and where the button strap joined the clog. The straps are too short for the size of the clog, and couldn't flip up over the arch. The left CROC strap was noticeably shorter than the right strap. When down, the straps down cut into my heel and pushed my toes uncomfortably into the front of the clog. I returned them.

Poor Quality & Size Problems
",VB,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Over the years I have fallen in love with my Crocs.  I have two pair, one made in China, and the other in Bosnia.  The fit great and have served me well.  This pair (made in Mexico) does not fit, they are too big.  They also feel thinner and even the straps that normally just fold up out of the way are not the same size.  If this is the new Crocs then I will find another brand and shame on the company for ruining a good product. If these are counterfeit, then shame on the supplier.  As always Amazon's return policy is quick & easy, however I  will still be paying $5 shipping. This is the second time I have ordered a clothing product from Amazon suppliers and the quality has been very sub standard.  In the future I will purchase such items locally and restrict my Amazon shopping to other categories.

Classic Crocs Fit Much Smaller
",Pamela J. Peerce Landers,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  If you are replacing a pair of old Classic Crocs today, be aware that the fit is much smaller. The length is 1/2 inches shorter. The width is narrower.  And, the strap is no longer flush with the back of the shoe, but 1/2 inch shorter. Result, a very tight uncomfortable shoe.The material of construction is also more rigid and less pliable.  New Crocs are more like Walmart knock-offs than like the original Crocs.I returned mine.  Will shop locally since sizing is now problematic. If shoes are rigid, will just wear my old ones into the ground.

Does not fit the fat
",Greek Witch,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  At 8 lbs a pop, I have what you might call fat feet. My whole life has been spent in envy of those endowed with more normal locomotory appendages. I can't wear sneakers, sandals, or loafers; sock after sock has split after insertion of my foot therein; each of my footsteps is a distinctive *splat* audible over a 100 meter radius. I thought that maybe, just maybe, Crocs would help me ""fit"" in. I've seen plenty of people wearing them around the trailer park - just once, might I be able to look like the cool kids? I was dead wrong. With the XXXL Crocs on my feet, I understood what Chinese foot binding must have felt like. Blood flow to the foot region slowed to such a trickle that each foot turned a mucous green. I had to use a steak knife to get the things off, cutting myself in the process, so that what little blood remained in my feet spurted all over my den and onto my adjacent daughter. I walked to the ER barefoot, cutting my feet yet further on the broken glass that littered the freeway shoulder. The nurses on staff snickered at me from behind their COVID masks. Moral of the story, you ask? Keep away from ""Crocs"" at all costs.

Crocs Review Correction
",MMP,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I originally left a positive review but after wearing these Crocs the size was just too small.  I purchased a pair of Khaki Crocs in April this year from Amazon and the size was perfect.  These Crocs were definitely smaller.  I thought I could make it work but then decided to return.  I was not offered to exchange for another pair.  This made me think that they know that this color in their Crocs was mis-sized.  If they would have offered another pair sized correctly, I would have definitely exchanged.  The color is really nice.

Not all crocs are made equally
",PR,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have gotten two pairs of crocs off of the actual website and I was pleased with them. When I saw Amazon had some at a cheaper price, I decided to try them using prime wardrobe. As soon I got them and tried them on, I immediately noticed a difference. The toe box was a little smaller and my feet would slide out when I would walk. I compared them to the crocs I got on the website, and the ones from Amazon definitely looked lower quality. The ""crocs TM"" logo across the strap wasn't as defined and the edges along the sides of the shoes weren't as smooth. The grips on the inside of the shoe weren't as defined either which is probably why my feet would slide out.. I looked at the tags and the ones I got from Amazon were made in Brazil while my other crocs from the website were made in Vietnam. I did research online and found that Crocs indeed has multiple factories across the globe, so the ones I were sent were likely NOT fakes. However, I am not the first person to note that the factories in Asia use a different mold than the ones in Brazil. Other people have also noticed a higher quality from the ones made in Vietnam. I TRIED to get myself to like these ones, but I just couldn't. Even if they were cheaper, I could TELL they were cheaper just by looking at them. I had to send them back. It's a shame that Crocs doesn't require the same mold and quality at all their locations. The lack of consistency is disappointing.

The little bumps on the sole of each shoe are very pointy and irritating.  Why do Crocs length and fit differ so much each time I order the exact same size and style?!?!  Waste of money.

",D. Deutsch,2.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I finally bought a pair of Crocs after finding them for the reasonable price of $19.99 on Amazon. I like Crocs, but I refuse to pay something like $30 to $45 for what essentially amounts to a pair of plastic slippers. I was skeptical of their usefulness, but they fill the niche (for me) between slippers and clogs pretty well.The fit was surprisingly small. I mean they are wide and clunky, but seem to run a bit short; I bought the 9 for my 8 1/2 foot, but there is not as much room in the toe-box as I expected. Despite being plastic, the shoes breathes very well and are comfortable enough for extended wear. Running to the mailbox or cleaning the house is an ideal use for this type of footwear. Beware taking out the garbage in the morning as the dew seeping through the holes will come as unwelcome surprise.Not that I knew I needed them, but Crocs are popular for a reason.  They are great for lounging around, but I am skeptical at the touted advantages of some of the more specialized models. Now, having bought a pair I feel existentially complete.Update 10/12/2012I am writing this review after about a week's worth of wear. The fit was simply too small and I had to give them away. I am trying the men's size 10 to see if they will be more comfortable. In my case it may be a matter of going a full size up.

  I am a woman who wears a size 10. The length is exaxt, and while I do understand the sizes were unisex, these are extremely wide for a normal sized ladies foot. My foot slides side to side in them. I also thought there would be at least a 1/2"" lift from front to back since there appears to be deep sole, however it is actually totally flat because your heel sits lower than the top edge of the heel. There are air holes that go around the front and sides of the shoe, and one in the front is in the exact place that my second toe sticks through it and debris gets in. The strap can swing frontward or backwards, however when it's backwards, it barely touches my heel since it's so long. It's not as cushy soft as other crocs I've tried on. They are something to kick around in, but nothing I would have bought had I tried them on at the store. I think I will stick to the ones made specifically for women.

I needed to return them because there was no way they were going to properly fit my foot. I still want a pair but I am worried that the next size up will not fit correctly either.

A little disappointing for a long time crocs wearer..
",Janet's Hartsburg,3.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I've been a dedicated crocs wearer for years for both work and play. I probably haven't bought a new pair for a couple years but finally decided it was necessary for safety reasons (when the tread is totally worn off they can be very slippery). The pair that I purchased was an A+ for comfort, as always. However, the construction of the shoe has been cheapened considerably. The straps spontaneously pop off, requiring that you realign and replace the heel strap to the croc. Have crocs become a victim of their own popularity..?

  These crocs are extremely practical despite the way they look. Feels like you are walking on air.  They are great when I wear socks with them but when I go without socks, they rub the top of both of my feet in the same place (where you would normally have shoe laces on a shoe) causing blisters/cuts.  Maybe I just need to get used to them, not sure.  Anyhow, these are great clogs with one major drawback.

Even with socks they are so big they will not stay on my foot. That includes using the strap,they are just to big.

",como651,1.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I used to love Crocs.  My first pair were the Classics then I got the slippers then the Yukon Sports and told everyone how great they were.  I could not have been so far from the truth.  These shoes keep podiatrists in business.  After 3 years of wearing my Classics nearly every day of the summer and spring I started to feel a growing discomfort in my knees when walking and especially when going down steps and began to suspect the Crocs when I noticed uneven treadwear.  I went to a podiatrist and he said the Crocs due to their spongy sole where not providing support or stabilizing my knees correctly.  He said I was experiencing pronation as a result which explained the uneven tread wear. He recommended Keen shoes instead.  I tried them on and it was immediate relief.  I could literally feel the pressure redistribute in my knees.  It felt like someone opened a pressure valve within my knee joints!  I also learned Crocs act as isolators and cause static electricity buildup which explains now why I regularly would get shocked when stepping out of my van.  Lastly, they are slippery as snot on wet concrete.  Almost went down several times.  They may feel soft on the feet but these things are the devil in disguise.

  I ordered two pairs of Crocs - one pair of thongs and one pair of cayman crocs. I used the sizing chart provided and ordered both pairs in M5/W7. However, when they arrived, while the Thongs fit perfectly, with room to wiggle, the Caymans were way too small (I'd almost say a full size too small). The Thongs were ""made in China"" and the Caymans ""made in Mexico"". I went to my local store and discovered that they receive Croc orders which are often made in multiple countries. It would appear to me that there is no ""standard"" mold used. So beware - just because you have tried them on in a store and think you have the correct size - you may end up getting a larger or smaller size, depending on where they are manufactured.

  Wir haben gleich 3 Paar dieser Schuhe in unterschiedlichen Gr√∂√üen und Farben gekauft. Da wir diese Schuhe im Garten und auf der Terrasse benutzen wollten, lagen sie bei uns immer drau√üen. Nach einigen Tagen in der Sonne sind sie so eingeschrumpelt, dass man unm√∂glich noch seinen Fu√ü hinein bekommt. Die schwarze 43/44 passt h√∂chstens noch jemandem mit Schuhgr√∂√üe 36, und die dunkelblaue 42/43 kann niemand mehr tragen, da sie sich zus√§tzlich auch noch vorne extrem nach oben gebogen haben und jetzt gute Clownsschuhe beim Kinderfasching w√§ren. Das dritte Paar hat sich nur ein wenig verzogen, vermutlich weil es die hellblauen waren und da die Sonne nicht so draufbrezelt. Geht jedenfalls √ºberhaupt nicht f√ºr den Preis! H√§tte ich bei 5‚Ç¨ Schuhen erwartet. Wenigstens ein Hinweis, dass man die Schuhe nicht in die Sonne legen darf, w√§re wichtig!

  Die Schuhe passen gut und sind bequem. Da ich sie haupts√§chlich im Garten und auf der Terrasse benutzt habe, standen sie logischerweise auch mal in der Sonne - mit dem Ergebnis, dass sie nach nur 3-4 Wochen mindestens 3 Gr√∂√üen geschrumpft sind! Im ersten Moment dachte ich, dass ein Kind seine Schuhe aus Versehen bei uns stehen gelassen hat, weil ich mir gar nicht erkl√§ren konnte, wieso ich pl√∂tzlich nicht mehr in die Schuhe passte!Dabei wirbt der Hersteller mit ""der perfekte Schuh f√ºr Strand oder Boot!"" Nur darf die Sonne eben nicht l√§nger scheinen. Amazon hat kulanterweise den Schuh zur√ºckgenommen und den Kaufpreis erstattet, obwohl die Frist zur R√ºckgabe bereits verstrichen war.Da bereits mehrere K√§ufer von demselben Ph√§nomen berichten, sollte man den Schuh auf keinen Fall kaufen, wenn man vorhat, ihn auch drau√üen zu benutzen. Sehr entt√§uschend.

  They have changed the shape and feel of Classic Crocs which I think is a shame. I prefer the rounded wide front and squishiness of my old style crocs, these are considerably narrower at the front. I'm sure they have done this to try and make them less disagreeable to the anti-croccers, but actually they look more silly in their new slimline shape. They are also firmer- I preferred them soft.

  I ordered these for my husband as a Christmas present.  He is size 7 so clicked on that size.  When they arrived they were good quality but looked too big, so Christmas surprise spoilt for him as I had to ask him to try them on just in case they were OK - but no they were much to big.  When I checked to bottom of the Crocs it said size 8.When you order the sizing chart shows mens size 7/women size 8 which I presume is wrong as generally women have smaller feet but quite what determines which size you get who knows a crystal ball maybe. I have had to return them so a complete waste of my time and a Christmas surprise spoilt.I now have a dilemma,  do I re-order size 6 hoping to get size 7 or just forget the whole thing.I noticed in the reviews that the quality is not generally in question but that wrong sizing  is a frequent complaint so maybe time the production information was corrected and customers stopped wasting their time..

  Others have commented on the strange sizing of Crocs, which seems to depend on whether they're made in Italy or China. I already had a pair of size 7s, which are roomy, so I only wear them round the house and garden.  And my son wears them (he's a size 9).  I needed something big to wear following a broken ankle so ordered a pair of black size 7.  They arrived and were visibly much smaller than the ones I already had. Small pair made in Italy, large pair made in China, both purporting to be size 7.  Really annoying.  I exchanged for a size 8 which is about the right size on my 'normal' foot - but I'm not usually an 8!Surely such a well known brand should be able to get its sizing right!

  The soles inside most Crocs have very small, slightly raised bobbles, presumably to invigorate one's feet, except these can cause nerve damage over time to diabetics' feet like my husband's and he has many various wide styles of other shoe makes bought from Amazon and been very satisfied. Eventually after only a fortnight, his Crocs were causing considerable nerve pain, so he bought gel insoles to prevent further discomfort.Otherwise Crocs are very comfy. They come in a variety of great colours and whose straps help keep one's feet safety inside the shoe.I wrote to Crocs many times, only to receive no reply.

  Sadly, I cannot get on with these crocs. I persevered for 2 days as I have used crocs every Summer for at least 20m years.I cannot wear these however as I think that the raised areas on the soles are too high.  The bottoms of my feet were too painful to persevere and further.By the raised areas, I mean the many bumps in the shoes.I printed a label and sent these crocs back to you last week so you should  have received them by now.  No sign of a refund to dateThese were returned via hermes on 26/05/2020. I guess hermes still has them.

  I usually buy Croc lookalikes (or mock crocs as I refer to them) from a well known high street shoe shop, but they seem to wear down on the heel quite quickly, so I thought I'd try the branded one's. I have wide feet, so purchase men's size 7 in the mock croc version. Other reviewers stated that sizing depended greatly on where their Crocs were made, but as I had no idea in advance which version I would receive, I thought I should stick with a size 7. I have to say mine are a little on the small side - not only narrower but also shorter in length. I wear them instead of slippers, so during the summer months they fit fine, but I cannot wear them with socks once it gets cooler - there simply isn't enough room in them. I think in future I will stick with the 2 pairs for ¬£8.00 mock crocs, and just replace them more often. I find it rather ironic that a cheaper high street pair, is more generously sized than the expensive branded version.

  Crocs are the best of a poor choice. The soles wear out in about 3 months so the real price is much higher. However they are amazing at keeping your feet cool and they're very comfortable. If Crocs could actually produce some modern progressive Clog designs they'd get five stars but their design or possibly their marketing department lets them down. Hire some good designers and let them do their job. We don't need wacky shoes with crazy two tone color schemes, just well designed ones.

  I was slightly disappointed by these. The insoles did not feel as comfortable or supportive as I'd hoped, and the size of the shoe was almost too short for my feet- it felt like my heel was hanging off the end of the shoe. However, width-wise, they felt too loose around my foot and wouldn't stay on unless I used the strap, which then pushed my foot forwards and squashed my toes. I wanted to use these as shoes/slippers to jump in and out of around the house, therefore they are no good for me and I will be returning them.

  I bought these as advertised size 6. When they arrived it said on the sole, women's size 8 and men's size 6. I am keeping them as they might be better with socks, in winter. However, if this had been clear on the advert, I would have bought a smaller size. It didn't say on the description on Amazon that it was Unisex and gave absolutely NO indication that size 6 meant men's size 6 which is different from women's size 6!! Size 6, to me, is unisex as in all other shops/shoes, a men's (or boys') size 6 is the right size for me.I am keeping them as I needed them urgently for work and it's too much hassle to return them as I will have nothing to wear at work in the meantime but PLEASE in future make this sizing VERY clear!!

  I have bought at least 20 pairs of Crocs and these are the first that don't quite fit. I would much rather have paid the extra ¬£10 and had a normal fit. The ones that I took off were sized 6 - 8 and made in Italy, just exactly the same as the new ones, but the new ones are slightly wider and have slightly bigger holes. Not happy, but these were the only Crocs on Amazon so no choice either.

  I bought these Crocs because I have other colours which I love, but these black ones appear to be of inferior quality.  The plastic is a lot harder and ungiving and therefore not nearly as comfortable.  Maybe they will soften in time, but I see no reason why a different colour should be any different in quality, especially as the price remains the same and I suspect these are manufactured by a different company, using cheaper materials.

  I read various reviews about crocs before ordering, and gathered from most that the sizings can be hit or miss. I therefore ordered two different styles and two different sizes.Jolly glad that i did. My normal size is a 6, but the size 6 that i ordered looked more like a childs shoe. There was no way my feet were going to fit into those. The pair i ordered in a different size and style fitted perfectly. My advice for this product would be to either order two pairs in different sizes or go for 2 sizes bigger than you would normally wear.

My sister returned the crocs and decided not to take a chance on the next size being a better fit and buy locally therefore able to try  on and save the possibly of having to return if wrong size. My advice  see if you can find out where they were made before buying and if China take a bigger size.  difficult to give a rating as the product is good but incorrectly sized.

  I've bought several pairs of Crocs previously and have had no problem with them.  However this pair are a poor fit and far too squashy.  They were made in China and I note my last pair were made in Italy and were much better.  With hidesight I should have returned them, however I've worn them and thrown away the packaging.  Unfortunately I'm unable to wear them any more.  I'm convinced the right one is wider than the left but can't prove it.  I will be more careful next time.

  Die Crogs wurden schnell geliefert.Eigentlich ist 1 Stern zuwenig, aber ich war so irritiert als sie kamen, das ich erst dachte eine Kopie gekauft zu haben.Die Gr√∂√üe ist nun ganz anders als ""fr√ºher""Ich habe derzeit - wie auf dem Bild zu sehen - ganz alte Crogs die mindestens 10 Jahre alt sind. Nun sind sie durchgelaufen, und einer an in der Sohle ein Loch. Deshalb mussten neue her.Ich habe die Gr√∂√üe, die 37/38 angegeben ist gekauft.Sie passen mir wie erwartet. Dennoch wundert es mich, das die alten eine Nummer kleiner waren, aber dennoch gr√∂√üer sind als die neuen.Also kauft jemand dieselbe Gr√∂√üe wie seine alten sind, werden sie viiiiiiiel zu gro√ü sein.Auf meinen alten steht noch ""Made in Italy"" auf den neuen ""Made in Vietnam"". Tja....Au√üerdem finde ich das die neuen h√§rter sind als die alten. Nicht mehr so flexibel.Fazit:Man kann sie kaufen, zumindest meine Farbe war g√ºnstig, aber andere sind teurer, und da w√ºrde ich schon nicht mehr empfehlen.Ich bin sehr gespannt wie sie sich in der Sonne verhalten, denn einige schreiben sie w√ºrden schrumpfen.Wenn dem so ist, haben sie nicht mal 1 Stern verdient.Meine jetzigen haben in all den Jahren ihre Gr√∂√üe beibehalten.Ich bin gespannt, und sollte dem so sein, das sie sich ver√§ndern werde ich leider nie wieder welche kaufen.

  I have chosen 2 stars not for the product, Crocs are brilliant, it is the sizing. I ordered a size 6 but received a size 5/6 and it was more of a 5. Instead of my son having them I have kept them for myself. I am now reluctant to purchase anymore from Amazon as it is always a pain to return goods. Also if you order a particular size you don't expect to receive a different one. Size 6 would have been fine.

  Ein schlechter Scherz??? Lustig und traurig zugleich.

Mein Sohn freute sich und meinte: ""cool, dann kann ich sie ja haben, wenn sie dem Papa nicht mehr passen!""Seine Freude war nur kurz, den ein Paar Tage sp√§ter passten sie ihm auch nicht und irgendwann dem J√ºngsten auch nicht mehr.

  I've been wearing Crocs for years and have more than 10 Pairs but something is really strange with the sizing of these Crocs.I wanted the color Orange and ordered the same size Crocs that I normally wear Size 10 womens / 8 mens ... oddly enough the Orange Crocs size 10W/8M were bigger (longer) than my other 10/8 Crocs ... weird?I read other reviews describing the same problem with sizing but didn't think they were accurate ... turns out they are.I tried to order a Size Smaller however Amazon didn't have Orange stock in the 9/7 size so I ended up returning them for a refund.I love CROCS and will continue to buy them although I am confused as to why this particular order and size didn't fit.Thankfully Amazon has a great return policy ... Hopefully they get more stock and I'll order again in a smaller size.

  Die Crocs wurden wie angek√ºndigt von Amazon geliefert. Zun√§chst passte auch alles. Habe absichtlich eine Nummer gr√∂sser bestellt. Die Schuhe waren angenehm zu tragen. Nach 5 Wochen und einigen Tagen aufenthalt der Crocs auf der Terasse waren diese um min. 2 Nummern geschrumpft. Zudem hatten sich die Schuhe so in L√§ngsachse verwunden das ein reinschl√ºpfen kaum m√∂glich ist. Das Tragen ist durch die Verwindung auch sehr unangenhem.Der Kundenservice von Amazon ist wirklich sehr freundlich. Ich bekomme ein neues Paar schuhe kostenlos zugeschickt. Ich werde es so gut wie m√∂glich vermeiden die Schuhe in praller Hitze liegen zu lassen, um die Schrumpfung und Verwindung zu vermeiden. Ich habe das Gef√ºhl das die Hersteller von dern urspr√ºnglichen Materialmischung abgewichen sind. Crocs trage ich seit 8 Jahren. Dieses Problem ist in diesem Umfang neu f√ºr mich.Ich bin mir am √ºberlegen ob ich 1 oder 2 Sterne geben soll. Ich gebe jetzt einen Stern, weil ich den Schuh eben meistens in den Sommermonaten trage. Sollte die Nachsendung besser halten, werde ich meine Bewertung entsprechend anpassen.

  I use to love crocs.  The new crocs are not the same size as the old ones.  As I have many issues with my feet, I have been wearing Crocs for a number of years.  I had read reviews about the sizing not being the same. I do agree.  They are also not making them with same quality as the older ones.  I wrote to Crocs company and said they were not any better than your department store shoe.  Except department store knock offs are much cheaper.  I have loads of knock offs.

  Ich brauchte dringend Gartenschuhe und habe mir daher die klassischen Crocs gekauft. Grunds√§tzlich sind die Schuhe gut verarbeitet, bequem und sehen hochwertig aus. Man kann sehr schnell rein und auch wieder rausschl√ºpfen, was f√ºr mich eine wichtige Voraussetzung f√ºr Gartenschuhe ist.Leider sind die Schuhe so weit geschnitten, dass mein (eher schmal geschnittener) Fu√ü komplett darin verloren ist und ich absolut keinen guten Halt habe.  Ich habe mir eine Billigmarke als Vergleich dazu bestellt und habe bei diesem das Problem mit der Weite nicht, zahle nur die H√§lfte und habe einen vergleichbar guten Schuh. Deshalb muss ich die Crocs wieder zur√ºckschicken und werde mir die Billigvariante stattdessen behalten.

Avendo un 43 abbondante , ho acquistato per uso domestico con fiducia la misura 43-44 che per√≤ ho trovato un po' larga. Non volendo restituire per cambio taglia pi√π piccolo per evitare di ritrovarmi, a detta di chi ha comprato la misura giusta, con un sandalo troppo calzante, ho preferito tenerli. Trovo il prodotto orribile dal design stile infermiere, ma risulta davvero leggero al piede e piacevole con il suo plantare. Trovo anche che si debba calzare necessariamente un calzino anche per casa per evitare che il piede cuocia al suo interno. Non capisco gli entusiasti di questa marca. Buona passeggiata...

  Zun√§chst machen die Crocs einen vern√ºnftigen Eindruck. Aber nach nur ungef√§hr 7 Monaten passen die Schuhe √ºberhaupt nicht mehr, da sich die Sohle durchgebogen hat und die Schuhe nun deutlich zu klein sind. Dabei wurden die Schuhe in der Zeit (vor allem √ºber den Winter) nur wenig getragen.Bei dem zeitgleich bestellten Modell meiner Frau treten diese Probleme nicht auf. Allerdings sind diese auch ""Made in Italy"" und nicht wie bei mir ""Made in Mexico"". Insgesamt kann ich von diesem Kauf daher nur abraten.Nachtrag: Ich habe die schwarze Version bestrellt (Roomy Fit).

  Ich habe mir vor etwa einem halben Jahr ein Paar dieser Crocs bestellt und wollte dann noch ein zweites Paar in derselben Gr√∂√üe und selben Farbe.Als ich das zweite Paar erhielt, habe ich zuerst bemerkt, dass diese um einiges enger geschnitten waren als das Paar mit derselben Gr√∂√üenangabe und mir daher √ºberhaupt nicht passten. Bei genauem Hinsehen und Vergleich fiel mir dann auf, dass sich das neue auch sonst von meinem ""alten"" Paar unterschied. Mein altes Paar war laut Aufdruck Made in Vietnam, das neue Paar Made in Bosnia. Zudem war der neue Farbton d√ºnkler.Offenbar unterscheiden sich die Produkte aus den verschiedenen Herstellerl√§ndern doch massiv, daher besteht hier das Risiko, ein f√ºr einen ""schlechteres"" Paar zu erwischen, mein zweites Paar ging daher zur√ºck.

  Ich vermag die vielen guten Bewertungen hier beim besten Willen nicht nachzuvollziehen. Die Clogs sehen gut aus und sind am Anfang auch tats√§chlich bequem. Ich habe davon insgesamt 3 verschiedene Modelle in verschiedenen Farben. Alle 3 Modelle verformen sich bei W√§rme und schmelzen bei Sonneneinstrahlung (Norddeutschland nicht Sahara) unter freiem Himmel locker um 2 Gr√∂√üen. Mit Sonneneinstrahlung meine ich weder Wintergarten oder Treibhaus, sondern wenige Stunden auf der Terrasse oder auf dem Eingangspodest vom Haus. Im Ergebnis mithin billigstes Material mit dem Schwerpunkt auf die Optik ohne jeglichen Qualit√§tsanspruch. Ich kann keine der drei Clogspaare mehr gebrauchen.

Compr√© la talla 41-42 de color NEGRO, que es equivalente a unas 10-12 porque ya ten√≠a unas blancas con esa talla, pero compradas en una tienda f√≠sica. Me llegaron y como se ve en la fotograf√≠a hay mucha diferencia con la misma talla, me quedan muy peque√±as.Pens√© que lo mismo estaban mal mis anteriores blancas, es muy raro que el mismo fabricante cambie tanto de talla y las he utilizado sin cerrar por detr√°s.El tema es que compr√© a mi mujer otras en otro vendedor de color ROSA talla 39-40 que es el equivalente a ellos 7-9 y pude comprobar que incluso son m√°s grandes que las que compr√© 41-42.Al final se ha quedado mi mujer con las negras porque no hay nada peor que ir con un calzado peque√±o.Es decir son las tallas de este vendedor las que son m√°s peque√±as que las otras y eso quiere decir que o est√°n mal rotuladas o no son aut√©nticas

  Tr√®s d√©√ßue par cette commande ""bleu navy"" que j'ai renvoy√©e car c'√©tait de fausses crocs, made in china, trop grandes, trop larges, dures, inconfortables alors que le plastique des vraies crocs est souple et doux. Auparavant j'avais command√© une paire d'un autre bleu, √† peine plus cher, made in italy, tr√®s agr√©able au pied mais un peu trop petite (38-39). Je croyais donc recevoir le m√™me mod√®le dans la taille au-dessus (39-40). H√©las non. Dans ce mod√®le de crocs, c'est la loterie. On ne peut se fier ni √† la taille, ni au prix.

  Sono purtroppo costretta a rivedere la prima recensione ... Dopo qualche giorno di utilizzo pi√π intensivo al mare, le ciabatte si sono ristrette di almeno una taglia ed ora non calzano pi√π... con il risuotato di essere inutilizzabili.Lascio, per completezza, la prima entusiastica recensione scritta non appena ricevuto e provato il prodotto... Ottime, calzano alla perfezione ed hanno l'inconfondibile qualit√† delle vere crocs. Arrivate imballate nella confezione originale, non fanno la puzza delle imitazioni economiche, indossate sono come un guanto e non provocano fastidi n√© sfregamento

  Ich wollte mir k√ºrzlich ein weiteres/neues Paar Crocs kaufen. Laut Beschreibung und Artikelname ist dieses Produkt exakt ""bauglich"" zu meinen bisherigen Schuhen. Als die neuen Schuhe dann geliefert wurden, die Entt√§uschung: Leider handelt es sich um ein v√∂llig anderes Material (fester, kaum weiche/nachgiebiges Fu√übett mit sehr unangenehm festen ""Noppen""). Ich habe die Schuhe daher zur√ºckgesandt und werde nun in Ladengesch√§ften nach Ersatz suchen m√ºssen.Ich kann mir diese Sache nur so erkl√§ren, da√ü Crocs an verschiedenen Produktionsstandorten weltweit hergestellt werden und es hier von Standort zu Standort massive Abweichungen in der Qualit√§t geben mu√ü.

  Allora o sono io che ho problemi a comprare crocs su amazon o c'√® qualche problema di fondo con tutte le crocs made in Vietnam. Prima di queste avevo provato il modelo crocband (arrivate sempre made in vietnam) e gi√† con quelle avevo problemi di taglia e di dolore alle ginocchia per come era stata costruita male la pianta del piede. Dopo il primo reso per la taglia ho deciso di cambiare e di prendere il modello classico che conoscevo, sperando d andare sul sicuro. Arrivate, comode, il problema √® che le due scarpe sono di dimensioni diverse. Ma che bello. Entrambe hanno impresso lo stesso numero sulla suola ma la scarpa destra √® pi√π grande della sinistra, e la differenza si nota gi√† ad occhio nudo. Fantastico. Quindi ora dovendo fare l'ennesimo reso nasce il dilemma: quale delle due scarpe rappresenta la taglia giusta? Il ""39/40"" dichiarato dovrebbe essere la sinistra che mi calza perfetta, o la destra che mi calza larga? Tra parentesi, normalmente porto un 38/39. Quindi il dilemma √®: devo riordinare la stessa taglia o prenderne una pi√π piccola? Questo sempre sperando che le scarpe mi arrivino della stessa dimensione a sto giro e non sia un problema dell'intera partita. Cio√® dai. O sono sfigata io o non si pu√≤.

  Wir hatten orangefarbene und hellgr√ºne Crocs, die nach vielen Jahren zu ersetzen waren.Haben durch dunkelblaue (""Navy"") in identischer Gr√∂√üe ersetzt. Nach 2-3 Wochen waren diese allerdings um gut 2 Nummern geschrumpft (dass es gut 2 Nummern waren, wei√ü ich erst jetzt, siehe weiter unten ...)Wenn man dazu im Web recherchiert, bzw. weit in den Tiefen der Crocs-Website, findet man die Hinweise,1. dass man Crocs nicht der Sonne aussetzen soll, was bei Outdoor-Schuhen, die auch mal auf der Terrasse bleiben, nat√ºrlich unsinnig ist bzw.2. dass Crocs aus einem besonderen Material w√§ren und sich dadurch an die F√º√üe Ihrer/s Tr√§gerIn anpassen w√ºrden.Wir haben mittlerweile folgende Ersatz-Crocs gekauft:a) 1 Paar in gleicher Farbe (""Navy""), aber 1 Nummer gr√∂√üer als ben√∂tigt=> sind erwartungsgem√§√ü wieder GESCHRUMPFT, aber offenbar UM  M E H R  ALS 1 NUMMER :((b) ein Paar rote (""Pepper""), ebenfalls 1 Nummer gr√∂√üer - UND DIE SCHRUMPFEN JETZT NICHTFAZIT:Man kann sich bei Crocs auf die Gr√∂√üe offensichtlich nicht verlassen, nach meiner Erfahrung schrumpfen dabei nur Schuhe in dunklen Farben.

  Ich hatte mir vor Jahren in den USA Crocs gekauft und habe sie geliebt. Sie standen bei Wind und Wetter vor der T√ºr und waren einwandfrei. Nachdem das Profil komplett abgelaufen war, habe ich mir dann diese hier bestellt. Zu Anfang war alles einwandfrei, sie waren nur gef√ºhlt etwas enger als die alten. Zwischendurch habe ich mich gewundert, warum der eine Schuh pl√∂tzlich dr√ºckt und reibt, aber nicht weiter dar√ºber nachgedacht warum. Den Sommer √ºber standen sie dann unbenutzt neben der T√ºr, da ich √ºberwiegend barfu√ü oder mit Flipflops unterwegs war. Heute wollte ich sie mit Socken wieder anziehen und habe sie nicht mehr an die F√ºsse bekommen. Sie sind locker 2 Gr√∂ssen geschrumpft und haben sich verformt.

Es w√§re noch nicht mal so schlimm, wenn er sich vielleicht nun wieder beim Tragen dehnt, aber nun ist er auch eine Nummer k√ºrzer und man steht st√§ndig auf dem Fersenteil. Davon abgesehen wirkt auch der nicht geschrumpfte Schuh nach einem Monat des Tragens als Hausschuh schon irgendwie ausgelatscht. Das waren meine ersten und letzten Paar Crocs.

  There are various ways to buy this product from this one page, and you will receive the same Crocs product either way, (which can be comfortable if you find the right size) but depending on colour/size availability, you may inadvertently purchase from a third-party seller.  If this happens, be aware that the return policy will require you to pay for return shipping for the ""privilege"" of trying them on, in my case, over $18.  This should be stated more clearly somewhere on the purchase page.  Along with the confusing sizing chart, just be very careful to buy from Amazon so that, if you're not quite sure that you will like them and that they will fit, you can return them without cost.

Grunds√§tzlich kann man die Schuhe nicht miteinander vergleichen, das Material ist deutlich h√§rter, das Fersenband zu lang. Irgendwie erinnern mich die Schuhe an einen Krabbeltisch im Discounter wo man Vergleichbares f√ºr 5 Euro bekommt. Bisher gab es Made in Italy, jetzt Bosnia... Schade

I actually ordered 4 pairs of crocs and so far received 3 pairs. 1 pair (pink) was for myself and so far has been the only pair I‚Äôm actually satisfied with. I‚Äôm giving 2 stars because the sizing I‚Äôve received for at least half this order is so far disappointing to say the least. My partner will likely never wear the pair I got him so that‚Äôs a waste of $50.

  Die Crocs waren f√ºr den Einsatz meiner Tochter im Krankenhaus bestimmt. Hat auch ein paar Tage funktioniert. Dann ist der Verschluss kaputt gegangen. Kann passieren. Einen Ersatzverschluss kann man nicht kaufen. Auf meine Mitteilung hin - √ºber Amazon - gab es bis heute keine R√ºckmeldung. Immerhin mehr als 14 Tage sind vergangen. Das ist nicht nett.

  Es gibt von diesen Crocs, zwei Versionen: die ""Made in China"" und die ""Made in Italy"". Ich hatte bisher immer die ""Made in China"" in Gr√∂√üe 12 und war mit denen auch h√∂chst zufrieden. Jetzt wollte ich meine gewohnte Gr√∂√üe 12 nachbestellen, bekam aber erstmals ""Made in Italy"". Das Material erscheint hochwertiger und weicher. Daf√ºr passen sie aber nicht mehr so gut wie die ""Made in China"". Sie fallen gr√∂√üer aus! Da sich die Crocs beim Tragen noch weiten, geht das gar nicht. Ich tausche jetzt gegen eine Nummer kleiner aus und wenn die dann passt, gibt's auch wieder 5 Sterne.

  Nach der Lieferung der ersten Bestellung musste ich feststellen, dass diese Schuhe zun√§chst sehr gro√ü geschnitten sind. Dies sollte sich jedoch rasch √§ndern: Die Ersatzlieferung wurde eine Nummer kleiner bestellt und passte perfekt. Allerdings nur bis zum ersten Sommertag. Ein Tag im Garten war ausreichend um die Gr√∂√üe von 42 auf 40/41 zu reduzieren. Mittlerweile haben die Schuhe so um die Gr√∂√üe 38 erreicht. Daher kann man jedem nur davon abraten, diese ""Schuhe"" im Freien zu benutzen. Von Seiten eines Markenherstellers ist es eigentlich eine Frechheit so ein Produkt in Umlauf zu bringen.Dieses Produkt ist schlicht und einfach nur Plastikm√ºll und muss der ordnungsgem√§√üen Entsorgung zugef√ºhrt werden.

  Pague casi 25 euros, a mi parecer nada baratas, las compre hace a√±o y medio y van aguantando bien el uso diario, pero no me han llegado a convencer del todo, solo los utilizo con calcetines y normalmente en invierno porque en verano me hacen sudar los pies. Pone que est√°n hechos en mejico, de talla me vinieron perfectas y el color era el que quer√≠a, aunque el acabado final del producto era bastante mejorable, con rebarbas en muchas partes y son bastante mas anchas de lo que me esperaba.

  Meine Tochter liebt ihre Crocs und f√ºr den Kanu Urlaub in Schweden waren diese Schuhe genau das Richtige. Seit dem Urlaub nutzen wir die Schuhe haupts√§chlich f√ºr den Garten und lassen sie  nichts B√∂ses ahnend auf der √ºberdachten  Terrasse stehen und jetzt der Schock, sie sind tats√§chlich um ca. 3 Gr√∂√üen geschrumpft. Daneben stehen auf der Terrasse auch ein Paar Billig-Crocs-Plagiate die immer noch die Form und die Farbe wie am Anfang haben, da kann doch etwas nicht stimmen. Dann kaufe ich doch lieber die billige Kopie und verzichte auf den Markennamen.

  Ich suchte weisse Clogs f√ºr die Arbeit im medizinischen Bereich. F√ºr mich pers√∂nlich war der Schuh etwas zu breit obwohl ich keine schmalen F√º√üe habe.

  Prinzipiell sind die Schuhe echt klasse. Sie sind sehr bequem und ich kann sie im Sommer im B√ºro genauso anziehen wie im Garten.Allerdings stehen die Schuhe dadurch auch mal drau√üen. Nach dem ersten Sommer waren sie dann zwei Nummern kleiner - unfassbar wie sehr sie eingegangen sind. Mir ist klar, dass man die Schuhe nicht einem st√§ndigen Sonnenlicht und W√§rme aussetzten sollte, aber auf der anderen Seite sollten doch gerade die Marken-Crocs zumindest einen Sommer aushalten. Insofern keine klare Kaufempfehlung.

Ich wollte wenigstens mal den Fu√ü reinstecken, um nach der Gr√∂sse zu gucken.

  They do come in large sizes such as 15 which is what I am but when it came it was way too loose. If you are going to buy this I would recommend that you get a size smaller then you are.

  I can't remember ordering these awful clogs, but somehow Amazon decided I should and sent them to me.  I have been trying to return them ever since with no success.  You can get similar clogs - the same clogs in fact - at a better price in virtually any shop that stocks this brand.  A total rip off, in my opinion.  They are horrid, far too large, etc etc etc.  I hate them.  Amazon, please come and take them away‚Ä¶  See the consumer credit act, trading standard laws, etc.  This is the UK.  You sent them, I told you I didn't want them, etc.  I am getting in touch with trading standards very soon.

  Gute Crocs  ""made in Italy"". Das Material ist etwas h√§rter als bei meinen Letzten ""made in bosnia"" aber trotzdem immer noch bequem.Korrektur 10.9.16 >>>>>Leider muss ich alle Sterne Streichen. Ich habe die Crocs ums Haus und im Garten ab und zu angehabt. Die meiste Zeit aber standen sie umher. (teilweise in der Sonne). Das hat Ihnen nicht gut getan. Sie haben sich verformt und sind inzwischen (3-4 Wochen) fast 2 Gr√∂ssen kleiner geworden.Meine Alten habe ich 3-4 Jahre gehabt und die waren einfach abgen√ºtzt aber Form und Gr√∂sse war immer noch OK.Meine erste Empfehlung nehme ich zur√ºck ,denn ""Schrumpfschuhe"" m√∂chte bestimmt niemand.Die Bilder zeigen wie die hier beschriebenen Crocs nach kurzem Gebrauch aussehen. Mit dem blauen guten Schuh,den ich vor ein paar Jahren gekauft habe, ist gut sichtbar wieviel kleiner der neue geworden ist.

  Die schwarzen Crocs passen, wie erwartet, gut, allerdings hatten  sie anfangs einen penetranten Plastikgeruch, der auch jetzt nach einer Woche noch nicht ganz weg ist. Vielleicht h√§ngt dies mit der Schwarzf√§rbung zusammen oder mit der Tatsache, dass sie in China gefertigt wurden.

  I bought the exact same pair a few years ago and love it, so I bought this one only to find it's 1.5cm smaller in length, width and height although they're both marked as the same size!!It's extremely disappointing to find out the Crocs brand is SO inconsistent with its sizing that ordering the exact same pair in the exact same size can make you end up with a whole size less.

  Well I should have taken more note of the other reviews! I have bought  many pairs of crocs for family members over the last two years but noted the comment about the change in sizing so ordered as advised - when the came they were much  much smaller than the the same sized Crocs bought a year ago; those were made in China the latest were made in Italy. Another reviewer expressed frustration that a company like Crocs cant get its suppliers to produce to a consistent size standard and I agree. You might as well buy locally - there are plenty of Croc lookalikes to choose from at a much lower price and they might not last as long but at least you know they fit

Das Material ist ein vollkommen anderes, als die Crocs aus Italien (habe alle meine durchgesehen und meine sind alle aus Italien und super!). Aber diese hier...nein Danke! Wie kann eine Firma wie Crocs nicht ""mitkriegen"", dass diese China-Crocs Vollschrott sind??? Sind viel h√§rter als die Anderen, stinken und haben seltsame ""Muster"" und sind nicht glatt wie die ""richtigen"". So kann man sich auch Kunden vergraulen! Ich werde jedenfalls keine Crocs aus China f√ºr teures Geld kaufen-dann wars das halt mit den neuen Crocs bei mir. Aber solch eine miese Qualit√§t k√∂nnen die behalten. Bin ma√ülos entt√§uscht von diesen Schuhen!P.S. stellt die Schuhe mal in die Sonne...auch ein sehr ""nette"" Erfahrung-die gehen n√§mlich ein!!!

Einziges Manko sind glatte feuchte Fl√§chen, daf√ºr hat das Material nicht den n√∂tigen Grip.Update 07.10.2014Ich muss meine Meinung √§ndern !Heute kam ein von mir bestellter Schuh an, in Form und Ausf√ºhrung der selbe Schuh wie anfang 2013 bestellt hatte und aktuell auch trage ! Der heutige gelieferte Schuh ist um 20 mm kleiner ! Insgesamt viel zu knapp ! Entspricht nicht der Gr√∂√üe, obwohl es nach Datenblatt und Einpressung mittig der Sohle der selbe Schuh ist ! Und das direkt bei Crocs √ºber Amazon bestellt ! Beide made in Italien !

  Es ist kaum m√∂glich, etwas Positives √ºber Crocs zu √§u√üern. Hatte mir mehrere verschiedene Modelle bestellt und auch in L√§den mal anprobiert. Kaum ein Schuh passt, weil die Gr√∂√üen keiner Norm entsprechen und sogar innerhalb eines Modells die Schuhe unterschiedlich gro√ü ausfallen. Das h√§ngt wohl damit zusammen, ob der Schuh in Asien oder Europa hergestellt worden ist (wird tats√§chlich in mehreren L√§ndern produziert, wobei die Italiener die besseren Schuhe herstellen). Manchmal miefen die Plastik-Clogs, jedenfalls die in Asien produzierten. Tragekomfort konnte ich nich feststellen. Das 41er Modell dr√ºckte an den Zehen, dass 42er schlappte, im geheizten Zimmer schwitze der Fuss in dem Plastik (trotz Bel√ºftungsl√∂chern). 2 Zehner zahlt man f√ºr den Namen, bestimmt nicht f√ºr Verarbeitung und so ein billiges Material.

  Eigentlich finde ich Crocs h√§sslich, habe mir aber aus lauter Verzweiflung welche bei einem New York-Urlaub gekauft, um die Fu√üm√§rsche durch die Stadt bei 40 Grad blasenfrei zu √ºberstehen. Seitdem bin ich Fan. Mein Kater leider auch und deshalb war es an der Zeit, die zerbissenen Latschen durch Neue zu ersetzen. Das war nicht so einfach, denn die Gr√∂√üen S,M, L usw stimmen nicht mit den europ√§ischen √ºberein. Au√üerdem waren die Schuhe Made in Mexico viel weicher und bequemer als die hier Made in Italy. Die Noppen im Fu√übett sind ganz sch√∂n hart. Was mich aber richtig nervt, ist, dass die Lasche nicht oben auf dem Schuh h√§lt, sie rutscht immer zur√ºck. Mein Kater macht √ºbrigens keinen Unterschied, er bei√üt auch in diesen Croc herzhaft rein....

But the Crocs would have been just what I wanted. I sent them back and stated I wanted a uk8, and got the same as the ones I had all ready sent back, so I now had another pair to return. I would have giving a 5 star but the mix up with the size I will give them a 3 star as the returns were very easy. Hopefully my money will be return as easy as the returns

  I suffer from plantar fasciatis in both heels and was recommended these crocs by a friend who had suffered from the same ailment and got great relief from this type of shoe.  Within half an hour of putting them on I was in complete agony and spent several hours afterwards off my feet as I was unable to even hobble, never mind walk.  Needless to say I was very disappointed as I expected to be able to walk easier and relatively pain free once I wore them.  However, they did arrive in excellent time and were comfortable once I put them on, shoe size, width etc. was spot on.  My problems only began once I actually started to walk in them.  Perhaps this type of shoe helps mild plantar fascitis but it is definitely not good for the more debilitating type.  I would recommend these shoes only for people who do not suffer from pain in their feet.

  Ich muss hier vorweg sagen das ich nur mal eine 5-Euro-Kopie der Schuhe hatte und diese nach 6 Monaten weggeworfen habe. Soweit so gut und hab mir hier die Originalen bestellt nachdem ich mich wegen den Gr√∂√üen erkundigt hatte.Mir sind Schuhe in 44 immer passend wenn nicht sogar ein wenig zu gro√ü und hatte hier 44/45 bestellt. Nach meinem Empfinden sind diese 43-43,5 in deutscher Gr√∂√üe. Zum Sitzen geeignet aber mehr nicht. Bin sehr leicht vorne angesto√üen bzw. es hat gedr√ºckt. Also Versandkosten zahlen und zur√ºck. Hier direkt ein Tipp: aufpassen bei WEM man bestellt! Hatte bei einem H√§ndler die Schuhe bezogen und dieser hatte keinen kostenlosen R√ºckversand. Au√üerdem waren die Schuhe in keiner anderen Gr√∂√üe mehr vorhanden. Gibt bei Amazon √∂fters mal kostenlosen R√ºckversand oder ihr bestellt euch direkt 2 Gr√∂√üen und eine geht retour. Als Anhaltspunkt k√∂nnt ihr nehmen 26cm Fu√ül√§nge ist 44/45, alles was dr√ºber ist gr√∂√üer bestellen.Hab mir die Crocs nochmal in 45/46 bestellt und bin gespannt ob diese passen (war im Schuhladen testen :))Ach ja da hier immer wieder mal das Produktionsland erw√§hnt wird, meine waren aus Mexiko und hatten den ganz normalen Geruch von neuen Plastikschuhen. Ist eben kein Leder und das sollte man immer ber√ºcksichtigen.

  Size is somewhat large. I had ordered for M12 as per chart : but is loose on length and width. The rear strap doesn't help much.However recently I ordered crocs flip flop of M12 size which fitted me perfectly. This Anomaly is confusing, particularly for online purchases.When I tried for return / cancellation option, the refund is limited to basic cost (Rs. 1764/- in this case) and balance Rs. 1300/- towards import / freight is to be absorbed by customers - which is a unfair burden.On screen the price indicated is Rs.1764/- but when you place order the cost comes to Rs. 3056/- which should be indicated initially. Overall you feel let down on a good product - first time Buyer need to be vey careful about size unless you have tried with friend or acquaintance and are very sure.To avoid hassles of import / refund you may buy online from shopcrocs.in - you wont have to take a financial hit.

  Leider musste ich feststellen, dass diese nicht gerade billigen Schuhe eine absonderliche Eigenschaft besitzen: Sie schrumpfen, wenn man sie in der Sonne oder in der Tageshitze drau√üen stehen l√§sst - nicht eine, nicht zwei, auch nicht drei, sondern bis zu vier Nummern.Meine Frau hat der ganzen Familie Crocs bestellt, mir selbst welche in Gr√∂√üe 42-43. Gedacht waren sie als Gartenschuhe oder f√ºrs Freibad, jedenfalls f√ºr drau√üen, was mir als Verwendungszweck nicht ganz abwegig erscheint. Doch nach einigen Tagen, an denen es recht hei√ü war, glaubte ich, die Schuhe verwechselt zu haben und die meines √§lteren Sohnes angezogen zu haben.Allerdings hatte die nun mein j√ºngerer Sohn an, weil seine nahezu auf Puppengr√∂√üe geschrumpft und sich bananenartig gebogen hatten. Das gleiche Ph√§nomen zeigte sich bei den Schuhen meiner Frau und meines gr√∂√üeren Sohnes.Nach l√§ngerem Gr√ºbeln kam ich zu dem Schluss, dass wohl alle Schuhe geschrumpft sein mussten und bei Nachforschungen im Internet durfte ich feststellen, nicht allein mit diesem Problem zu sein.CROCS schrumpfen bei Hitze in der Sonne, jedenfalls diejenigen, die wir erhalten haben - und auch diejenigen anderer.Dies sind die ersten Schuhe, bei denen mir Derartiges passiert ist.Meine Schuhe mit Gr√∂√üe 42-43 passen nun nicht mal mehr meiner Frau mit Schuhgr√∂√üe 39.Diese Schuhe sind zum Wegwerfen.Ich werde mir jedenfalls keine mehr kaufen und kann sie gewiss niemandem empfehlen, da es auch kein vereinzelter Vorfall ist, wie jeder nachgoogeln kann.

  Y es por el precio y por el aparente ""√©xito"" de dicho calzado que me decid√≠ a probarlas.Primeramente quer√≠a decir que la talla es de broma. Pido unas 39/40 alarmado por los comentarios de otros compradores y a√∫n as√≠ me sobra zapato. Es grande...Despu√©s de investigar un poco sobre las crocs he llegado a la conclusi√≥n de que no son un zapato de calle. Buscad y leed que pueden ocasionar problemas musculares si andais mucho con ellas. O que la etiqueta que traen y que advierte de tener precauci√≥n en las escaleras mec√°nicas es porque ya ha habido gente lesion√°ndose con ellas... algunas muy gore....Para mi suerte, yo buscaba hacerles un uso 100% dentro de casa como zapatillas de estar por casa.Y CUMPLEN porque:1 Amortiguan muy bien la pisada y tienen una zona de masaje por todo el pie (si hace algo o no, ni idea, pero ah√≠ est√° y se nota).2 De momento no cogen olores raros (salvo su pl√°stico caracter√≠stico)3 Son c√≥modos y protegen el pie de golpes contra picos y patas de los muebles (al ser goma (o lo que sea) no notas dolor al impactar accidentalmente en cosas)4 Son antideslizantes SIIIII y da igual si pisas lo fregado que no deslizas. Pero ojo, que la bronca de tu pareja / padres por pisarles lo recien fregado no te la quita nadie.De todas formas y desde un punto de vista pr√°cticos tienen DEFECTOS....1) 42 euros.... estamos locos? que es un pol√≠mero (pl√°stico) insertado en un molde y ya est√°.2) El pie suda... Yo me pongo calcetines para no sentir tanto el tacto directo y a√∫n as√≠ las zonas con mucho contacto con el material sin agujeros suda y el calcet√≠n puessss algo si que se nota h√∫medo.3) Se rozan facilmente y pierden material de la suela (que se desgastan r√°pido, vamos).Mi conclusi√≥n es que puede que repita (a precios amazon) este calzado PARA USARLO POR CASA. O incluso entiendo gente que est√° mucho tiempo de pie y las usen para trabajar pues son c√≥modos y el pie respira m√°s que con otro calzado cerrado.PERO NO ES UN CALZADO DE CALLE... da problemas musculares, se desgastan r√°pido y es antiest√©tico.

  Leider ist bei diesen Crocs in der Farbe Braun tats√§chlich das wahr geworden, was schon mehrere K√§ufer in ihren Rezensionen berichtet haben: die Crocs sind in der Sonne geschrumpft.Gekauft im April haben sie nun gut 3 1/2 Monate im Freien auf der s√ºdseitigen Terrasse verbracht und auch gute Dienste beim Rasenm√§hen, Badmintonspielen und im Gem√ºsegarten getan. Nun sind sie von Gr√∂√üe 40 auf ca Gr√∂√üe 38 eingegangen - nun passen sie nicht mehr meiner Mutter, sondern meiner 14-j√§hrigen Nachbarin :)Gerade an der Fersenpartie sind sie erheblich schm√§ler geworden, aber auch in der L√§nge geschrumpft.Ansonsten waren die Crocs vom Tragegef√ºhl und von der Haltbarkeit bisher sehr gut, auch der Preis mit gut 16 ‚Ç¨ war sehr g√ºnstig. Aufgrund des Schrumpfens aber, vor allem schon nach so kurzer Zeit, gibt es von mir leider nur zwei Sterne, da sie von meiner Mutter so nicht mehr getragen werden k√∂nnen.Eine gute Alternative zu diesem Modell haben wir allerdings schon gefunden:¬†

L'ho restituito e successivamente mi sono preso un 43/44 che comunque risulta ancora leggermente troppo largo/lungo...probabilmente la misura ideale per me sarebbe il 43 che per√≤ non esiste, magari prover√≤ in futuro a prendere un 42/43 per vedere coma va.Ad ogni modo, nonostante questo le ciabatte sono piuttosto comode.Come ultima nota il fatto che nonostante le Crocs arrivate fossero made in Italy, la plastica emanava un fortissimo odore.

Ich lie√ü sie, wie man es mit Gartenschuhen so macht, auf der Terrasse stehen.Nach einem hei√üen Tag schl√ºpfte ich abends in die Schuhe und kam nicht mehr hinein. Zuerst dachte ich, es hat mir jemand einen Streich gespielt oder vielleicht die Schuhe verwechselt. aber ich las dann auf der Website des Herstellers nach, dass die Schuhe tats√§chlich in der Hitze schrumpfen k√∂nnen, und zwar um mehrere Schuhgr√∂√üen.So toll die Schuhe am Anfang waren, ich w√ºrde sie deswegen nicht mehr kaufen.

  Not sure if Crocs has changed something with their sizing, but I already owned a pair and ordered based on the size moulded on the bottom (in the same same style) but the pair Amazon sent was much much smaller.

  Leider ist es bei Crocs Gl√ºckssache, ob man die Ware aus China, Italien, Vietnam, Mexico oder sonstwo her bekommt.

Ich hatte einen sehr schmerzhaften Fersensporn. Jetzt sp√ºre ich gar nichts mehr. Das jetzt bestellte Paar, gleiches Produkt, ist zum einen zu klein und zum anderen aber auch eine ganz andere, leider schlechtere Qualit√§t. Das Material ist h√§rter und macht nicht den Eindruck, dass es lange durchhalten wird. Die werde ich zur√ºck schicken.

  Da kauft man extra ""echte"" crocs,weil man hofft, das es eine gute Qualit√§t ist und wird nach ein paar Wochen eines besseren belehrt! Zum einen haben die crocs total stark nach ""Chemie/Gummi/Plastik"" gerochen, was schon unangenehm war. Und zum anderen stehen die crocs bei Wind u Wetter auf der Terasse und sind tats√§chlich bei starker Sonnenhitze ""eingelaufen"", d. h. der gesamte Schuh hat sich zusammengezogen, so das er nun nicht mehr der angegebenen Gr√∂√üe entspricht. So etwas habe  ich noch nicht erlebt! Wir haben ganzj√§hrig mehrere Crocs auf der Terasse stehen und bei keinem anderen Paar ist das passiert!

Obwohl ich meine √ºbliche Gr√∂√üe bestellt habe (M6/W8) passen sie nicht. Sind ca. 1cm kleiner als gewohnt. Auch das Material ist viel h√§rter, sehr unangenehm sogar. Sowohl die letzten Classic, als auch diese sind beide 'Made in Italy'.

  Da mein Freund seit vielen Jahren seine Crocs zu den unterschiedlichsten Aktivit√§ten und Jahreszeiten tr√§gt, habe ich mich schlie√ülich auch dazu entschieden - ein totaler Reinfall! Im Mai habe ich sie zum ersten Mal beim Ostseeurlaub (Fr√ºhlingswetter) getragen. Ich war geschockt, als ich am n√§chsten Tag feststellen musste, dass sich das Material komplett verzogen hatte und das Produkt wie geschrumpft erschien. Das Resultat waren unangenehme Druckstellen an den Fu√üinnenseiten und Zehen, da kein Platz mehr blieb. Sofort habe ich die Schuhe reklamiert und anstandslos ein neues Paar geschickt bekommen. Auf dem Foto ist der Unterschied ersichtlich: es ist dieselbe Gr√∂√üe! Ich hatte das Ersatzpaar nicht direkt gebraucht und erst k√ºrzlich verwendet, aber die Freude war von kurzer Dauer. Auch das Material des Ersatzpaares hat sich komplett verformt, ohne dass die Schuhe der prallen Sonne ausgesetzt waren.

  Very different quality from my old pair: the material is slippery on the inside and rigid, the mold seams have plastic residue hanging off. Came in a plastic bag with a completely unrelated safety label not even mentioning the Crocs, about safely travelling on escalators and moving walkways (?) Makes me wonder if the Crocs' quality just went way down or what is going on??? Is it even the original product? Not happy with the purchase!

  Worin unterscheiden sich Original Crocs von (billigeren) Nachahmungen? Fr√ºher h√§tte ich gesagt, in Hinsicht von Verarbeitung und vor allem in Hinsicht Formstabilit√§t sind die Originale den Nachahmungen haushoch √ºberlegen. Leider wurde ich nun eines Besseren belehrt. War es bei den ersten Modellen noch gar kein Problem, dass man die Schuhe einen Tag lang drau√üen in der Sonne stehen lie√ü folgt nun mittlerweile die gro√üe √úberraschung: Wie von Zauberhand verringert sich die Schuhgr√∂√üe (-breite) um ca. 4-5 Nummern. --> Schuhe kann man gleich in den M√ºll werfen. F√ºr mich wars das auf jeden Fall mit Crocs, ich werde mir sicher das Geld sparen und gleich zu den billigen Produkten greifen. Da wei√ü ich wenigstens, was mich erwartet.

Dieses Ph√§nomen tritt wohl gerne auf bei Schuhen ""Made in China"", wie ich in diversen Bewertungen nachlesen konnte.

  La talla no coincide, son un poco grandes. Tengo varias Crocs, todas de la talla 10, y estas a pesar de que pone talla 10, son muy grandes. No volver√© a comprar este producto en su web.

  Amazon Prime is amazing! You can get the wrong size delivered the very next day - not once, ladies and gentlemen, not twice, boys and girls, but THREE TIMES! I ordered size 10 and I keep receiving size 11. It's taken me 64 years for my feel to grow to size 10, I'm not sure how long they'll take to reach 11. I could stuff the packaging into these size 11 Crocs to pad them out a bit, I suppose. I've looked on Amazon for a pair of size 11 feet, but any search involving body parts is frowned upon, it seems. I'd like to review the product, they look fine, and I'm sure that if I ever received a pair that fitted they'd do the job nicely, but without a road test a review would be meaningless. So, back goes another pair. Which way is the High Street .......?

  Zuerst war alles prima. Die Lieferung war am n√§chsten Tag da, der Artikel gefiel und pa√üte gut. Der Schuh ist federleicht und tr√§gt sich angenehm.Am n√§chsten Tag stand er dann einen Nachmittag lang auf der Terrasse in der Sonne. Als ich abends wieder reinschl√ºpfen wollte kam die gro√üe √úberraschung. Ich kam gar nicht mehr in den Schuh hinein. Er mu√ü durch das Stehen in der Sonne geschrumpft sein. Mu√ü also ein sehr minderwertiger Kunststoff sein, denn sonst passiert das eigentlich nicht. Ich werde den Schuh erst einmal zur√ºckschicken und einen Ersatz kommen lassen. Vielleicht war es ja ein Montagsmodell. Wenn nicht - dann war das mein erster und letzet Crocs.

  Crocs sind praktische Hausschuhe, bequem, schnell an und auszuziehen, d√§mpfen die Schritte auf Parkett/Dielen, halten die F√º√üe warm ohne schwitzen (zumindest bei mir). Merkw√ºrdig jedoch, dass die Firma Crocs das mit den Gr√∂√üen nicht hinbekommt. Ich wollte mir neue Crocs gleicher Gr√∂√üe bestellen. Auf meinen alten Crocs stehen die Zahlen 10 und 12. Leider muss ich hier bei Amazon die Gr√º√üen in 43/44 etc. ausw√§hlen. Also auf die Crocs Homepage, um dort an Hand einer Gr√∂√üentabelle abzugleichen, welche Gr√∂√üe ich bestellen muss, um wieder ein Paar der Gr√∂√üe 10 und 12 zu erhalten. Aber Fehlanzeige, auch auf der Crocs Homepage ist nur von 43/44 etc. die Rede.Also mutig 43/44 bestellt und siehe da, es stehende Zahlen 10 und 12 auf der Unterseite der Crocs. Und trotzdem sind diese einen Tick kleiner, obwohl es sich bei beiden um die Classic handelt. Au√üerdem scheint das Material h√§rter, die Crocs d√§mpfen weniger, die Noppen im Fu√übett dr√ºcken beinahe unangenehm.

  These genuine Crocs were not a UK size 12 as advertised and as per the Crocs label.  I have been buying my Dad size 12 Crocs for years without any problem with the sizing.  His Crocs that fit have the number 12 on the sole.  These had a number 13 on the sole but the label clearly stated ""UK 12"".  They were too big.  My Dad has mobility issues and having shoes that fit is imperative to his being able to walk safely and confidently.  Unfortunately I could not return as I trusted the label which I had removed and had written my Dad's name on (he lives in a care-home).  This has put me off buying genuine Crocs on-line.

  This is the 3rd pair of Crocs I have bought online. Always same size, for my father and myself. However, this time, although the specs are exactly the same (as shown on the soles) the crocs are 2 cm shorter than previous pairs. We only noticed this fault when I gave the crocs as a gift to my dad, who lives overseas. It is frustrating and embarrassing. Also, it is very inconvenient to bring the crocs back to the UK, ship them back, etc. Very poor experience due to these nonsensical, inconsistent sizes. My advice: buy your Crocs in a normal retail store, as Amazon has proved unreliable in relation to sizes.

  Per qualche motivo [probabilmente economico] Crocs ha cambiato il disegno dell' interno delle scarpe. Io ho un paio di Crocs Classic Sabot che ho comprato 5 anni fa e sembrano imbottite in qualche modo. Sono morbide e molto comode. Pero' le suole sono consummate e quindi sono molto pericolose sul bagnato. Adesso invece le scarpe dentro sono dure e dopo poco tempo danno fastidio al piede. Sono diventate come qualsiasi altra imitazione delle Crocs che si trovano in giro per meno della meta'.

  Ich hatte ja bereits aus vorhergehenden Rezensionen erfahren, dass die Crocs ""Made in China"" extrem schlecht sind, ich kann das nur best√§tigen, die Schuhe stinken so extrem, dass ich sie nicht tragen m√∂chte, sie gehen sofort zur√ºck - Schade!!! Da leider beim Einkauf nicht angegeben ist, ob aus Italien oder China und meine Vorbesteller mal so mal so bekommen haben, habe ich es einfach mal versucht - und Pech gehabt. Liebes Amazon-Team, wenn ihr das lest, bitte verkauft keine Made in China Crocs mehr. Ihr spart euch jede Menge Retouren dadurch.

How Crocs Changed My Life
",Heidi Bumanlag,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I will admit, I once was a hater. I lived a hateful negative life where I truly despised this footwear. But recently I've made many drastic life changes and these shoes have helped me see the light. They have helped me to see the beauty of the world and give me the confidence to face whatever obstacles life may throw my way. I can now walk outside with confidence. These shoes, these marvelous shoes, help me to live my life to the fullest not only in style but with such comfort no amount of words can begin to describe. I will now continue to live my life with an open mind to such fashion statements. No more will I live with my head hung low, but now I wear my crocs with pride. Sports mode empowers me while relaxed mode truly is the epitome of serenity. Crocs have also been the glue that has bonded me and one my best friends. Crocs truly change your life and bring people together. I will forever be indebted to this spectacular shoe.

Freesail vs Classic
",Jeanne,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I own 2 pair of Crocs women's Freesail and figured I'd try a pair of the classics.  The Freesail are much trimmer & narrower in width than the  women's Classics.  I love both.  The Classics are quite a bit boxier and wider in width  than the Freesail and the Classics seem to have a bit more  cushioning on the bottom.  Both work well for my problem feet which are usually sporting the Alegria brand shoes/sandals  for work.  However, on weekends and downtime, I prefer Crocs.  I have hammer toes  and deteriorating foot joints and have lost most of natural cushioning on the bottom of my feet making it feel like I'm walking on marbles. I typically wear a women's 8/12 or a European size  39.  In Crocs, I always  go a size 9 for the length.  I love both the Freesail and Classics and would urge anyone with ""touchy feet"" to give these a try.

Cutest Comfy Ugly Shoe You Can Buy
",FLRL,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I bought this classic fit (wide) shoe in size 6 men to get a size 8 women's.  It fits perfectly.  Most comfortable shoe or clog ever.  They are also ugly but they are so ugly that they are cute. To be clear, I bought these to wear with fluffy socks so I have the room I need (my feet are not wide) when wearing the fluffy socks. The strap can be in the back or in the front.  I like having it across my heel when wearing socks.  Feet don't sweat thanks to all of the vents.  You can also put cute little Jibbitz on them that people will notice and take their attention away from the ugly shoes.  You can wear these things all day, 10-12 hours and your feet and legs will hold out.  I got the original classic style because so many people online complained about the soles coming apart on the newer style.  So buyer beware, if you try them you will love them.

  I never, ever thought I'd wear Crocs, but here I am.Our 1.5 year old daughter loves her Crocs, and we like how easy it is to get them on, how we don't have to fuss over socks, etc. They're great summer shoes for kids. After a while I started thinking about getting myself a pair just as yard work/grilling/fishing/etc. shoes for the same reason. Which is what they started as, but during one Home Depot trip I realized I never took them off and was wearing them out. Fair game, I guess I'm living the Croc life now.Regarding sizing, I saw some strange advice all over. And perhaps it's different between colors, so for clarity's sake I got the Khaki color. Anyway, I saw some people talking about sizing down, but I really don't think that's the right way to go. Crocs do feel loose on your feet, but just wear them around a bit and you'll realize that they're just fine and very secure. The bottom ""floats"" a little bit so you don't develop blisters, but the strap holds them to your feet pretty well. If this were a normal shoe, then I'd size down. But it's not, and it doesn't wear/stretch/weigh the same, so I recommend getting your true size. I'm a 12D, sometimes 11.5 or 12.5, and once in a blue moon a 13. Size 12 works fine for me here.

  Never thought I'd buy a pair of crocs. I've been making fun of them for the past decade but when we moved into a new place with hard floors, I needed something to wear around the house. I stand/walk a lot at work and wanted something that was very comfortable.Got these bad boys and couldn't be happier. After a long day in dress shoes I look forward to wearing these when I get home. Great for working around the house and going up and down the stairs on hard flooring. I flip the strap up and go for the clog configuration. The look better that way and stay on fine without the strap behind your heel. Also nice that they are pretty grippy. I wear them cooking in the kitchen and don't have any issues when I spill stuff on the floor.I would definitely recommend these to anyone. They don't look the coolest but I'm a dad now so I'm fine with that. They are a much more comfortable upgrade from flip flop or slipper for wearing around the house. My only regret is not getting a cool color. If you're gonna get crocs you might as well go big!

  I ordered 2 pairs of these crocs classics, cerulean and pepper. Pepper is a true red (I was worried it might look pink) and the cerulean is very blue, not purple at all. I usually wear men's size 8.5 shoes and an m8/w10 fit when tried on in a store. However I read lots of reviews that said the sizes were very inconsistent. I need these soon so don't have time to mess with exchanges so I ordered m8/w10 and m9/w11. They were exactly the same size. Width, length, everything was the same, it was weird. I think they fit more like a m9/w11 but that's fine. I wanted/expected these to be pretty loose like my old ones from over a decade ago. These are pretty comfy like I remember and hopefully they last like my old ones did. I didn't find them shiny, uncomfortably small/narrow or the nubs inside to be too painful, which were all common complaints. Overall I say try them on in store first especially if you're in between sizes. I have high hopes for these. (These are the made in mexico ones by the way)

Over the years I've had to return or give away shoes I carefully chose, cos only the front of my feet are wide (like a duck). Have to have some sort of strap, or tie on.  My siblings would urge me to try them, so I took the plunge. The 1st pair had to be returned because of a simply mistake at the factory; the wrong size was put in the box.  The replacement arrived yesterday, and I could turn cartwheels, if I could. So comfortable, roomy, and no breaking in period.

  I will admit, I once was a hater. I lived a hateful negative life where I truly despised this footwear. But recently I've made many drastic life changes and these shoes have helped me see the light. They have helped me to see the beauty of the world and give me the confidence to face whatever obstacles life may throw my way. I can now walk outside with confidence. These shoes, these marvelous shoes, help me to live my life to the fullest not only in style but with such comfort no amount of words can begin to describe. I will now continue to live my life with an open mind to such fashion statements. No more will I live with my head hung low, but now I wear my crocs with pride. Sports mode empowers me while relaxed mode truly is the epitome of serenity. Crocs have also been the glue that has bonded me and one my best friends. Crocs truly change your life and bring people together. I will forever be indebted to this spectacular shoe.

Crocs are my life
",martina machado,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Where do I begin. If you do not own a pair of crocs by now, you need to buy yourself a pair right now. I used to buy ‚Äúcrocs‚Äù from the 99 cents store because I was on a budget, and by budget I mean absolutely broke. It wasn‚Äôt until I got my first job two years ago where I bought my first real pair and mannnn when I tell you that these are the most comfortable shoes ever, these are the most comfortable shoes ever. I can‚Äôt believe I was walking around in the knock off ones with no support, no wonder my back hurt so much. Well here I am two years later and I own 18 pairs of crocs. Everybody used to make fun of me but now I have people asking me for croc recommendations. If you are worried about looking dumb because these aren‚Äôt the cutest foot wear out there, these shoes are made to help you come as you are. If you are confident, it shines through. I almost have every color in the classic clogs and I am now going to invest in some bayaband, lite ride and bistro clogs. Crocs are an everyday, every moment type of thing for me and I am so glad that I am able to truly express myself through my beautiful crocs.I WILL SAY AS A SIDENOTE, those who experience discomfort, it may be because you have a flat foot as those with flat feet are better of wearing shoes like vans, converse, etc. (shoes that have no arch support)

Works great on my feet!
",rabbit,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  My chiropractor recommended wearing crocs since I started having plantar fasciitis problems. I usually wear woman's size 8 shoes, and got these in size 8. They seem a little big but it's actually more comfortable to wear that way, so I think these fit me perfectly. I like to life up the back holder part and wear them around like sandals. It's also nice when it's cold cause I can just slip them on with my socks on. As for dealing with my plantar fasciitis, it ended up working for me! I wore these every day, and at first I didn't notice that much of a difference and my feet ached in the morning for a while too, but around a year into wearing these, I have completely recovered from plantar fasciitis!! It's like I never even had plantar fasciitis before! I think it took a while for my feet to heal since it's something we use every day. Now I am able to wear normal flat sandals too and my feet are fine in the mornings. I still wear crocs and their brand sandals for my main footwear though, cause I think it helps to prevent plantar fasciitis from happening.

  So full disclosure in this review so please don't judge. There aren't any Crocs stores in the area I live in but I heard they were really comfortable and good support for people who are on their feet all day. I have issues with my arches and typically wear arch supports in my shoes so that I can both walk better and so my feet don't hurt. When I don't wear my arch supports, my feet hurt and the pain radiates up to my knees and higher. I love to wear flip flops but if you are like me, your doctor told you heck no that's horrible for your feet.So, I purchased a bunch of ""garden"" shoes or fake crocs. Don't get me wrong these are amazing and I wear them all the time I just had no idea that they weren't real crocs. Let me try to explain.I saw the yellow colored crocs in DSW about 3 weeks ago and fell in love, but of course they didn't have any more even online in my size in yellow. I come to trusty old AMAZON and they are selling for more than $40. No thank you I will wait. I check out the CROCS site and with shipping its more than that. So I wait. I wait and wait until they drop down to $31 and change and I get em. Now you guys don't know me but I am just excited to add another color to my collection so I thought.I sprayed them down with Lysol after I open the zip lock bag they were in and sat them on my back porch you know for safety and all that good stuff. So I take the trash out and remember that they are out there so I bring em in and wash em off again because now they have outside germs even though no one has been on or near my back porch. I dry them off and put them on my feet.HALLELUJAH!!!!I thought I had ascended to heaven! You don't know the struggles I have with these here size 8's. The support I felt, the cushion I felt, the prinkly things in the shoe that massage my feet while feeling slightly weird when my toes touch them when I am sitting, it all was surreal. I woke up my brother. I went outside and screamed YES YES YES like I was a WWE wrestler. I immediately came back to amazon to look and see what color shoe I didn't have to order more.Needless to say, I look at price too and I can't afford any of these colors at this time but I LOVE MY YELLOW CROCS. I prefer crocs over sneakers or tennis but I wear tennis to protect my foot in case I feel like jogging or running.Buy you these shoes. Don't have any yet? Ain't nothing like the real thing is all I have to say.TRUST ME ON THIS ONE!Signed,A Satisfied customer

",Simone Alicia,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Ordered a W8. This is my first pair of Crocs & I‚Äôm not sure whyyyyyy I waited this long to get a pair. Now I see why ppl use it. Very comfortable. I‚Äôm flat footed. I was able to wear it barefoot & also w| thin socks (tester around the house). The strap part to keep your feet in, it‚Äôs actually shorter than the actual length of the shoe (it‚Äôs not lined up with the heel part . Around a quarter of an inch or so from the heel) so when it goes around the back of your foot, it actually pushes your feel more inside the shoe. This isn‚Äôt a big deal for me as I‚Äôm actually a 7.5 women‚Äôs. I always love ordering any shoe item a half size bigger to have the extra room for thicker socks if needed. My Crocs were made in Mexico. I‚Äôve seen some complaints about sizing issues when it‚Äôs made in different countries. Anyways, I would recommend a pair to anyone.

Great versatile play shoes
",Kate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  We love crocs- all of my kids have a pair as their summer play shoes! We have a small farm and these are perfect- they can step in anything and hose off without a problem, wear them to play in the creek or the pond (if they come off in the pond they float and are easily retrievable!), and the versatility of wear with the heel strap makes it great for super active kids that like to run. I purchased this pair for my oldest, and as usual they are slightly bigger but we expected that. Great product.

The advice is to go a size down, but I suggest going a size up!
",elliot :-),5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I love these shoes! Crocs are silly looking yes, but that is what I love about them! I'm writing this review mainly just to note that in the description, it advises that if you're a half size to go a size down, since crocs can be large fitting/wide. However, this wasn't the case for me. I'm a size 7 and 1/2 in womens, so I chose a size 7, but I had to return it as I found it too tight fitting. If you fit size 8 converse just fine, then you most likely have feet similar to mine, so I'd recommend going a size up! Even without socks, it was uncomfortable enough for me to have to return it for a larger size.Besides the size issue, the shoes are wonderful! The coupon is also a great deal.

  I ordered the yellow (beautiful , bright color by the way) ! The shoe itself fits PERFECTLY!! I ordered my regular size and the fit is right on. My only concern is (after reading previous reviews about counterfeit shoes) after comparing them to my other CROCS (whom I know for a fact are authentic) , things does seem a little off. I‚Äôm not sure if it means anything . But my other crocs read ‚ÄúMade in Vietnam‚Äù and these read ‚ÄúMade in China‚Äù ... which has me a little confused. Again , IT MAY BE NOTHING !! I just had to point out that fact . Which that may be why these looks a little cheaper than my originals . They look kinda like they were RUSHED on the assembly line when you‚Äôre looking at them closely  . Other than this . They‚Äôre great ! Great color , size , fit . I‚Äôm definitely gonna keep them !

  Anyone going on deployment needs Crocs, so I got these for $30ish. They came in a plastic Crocs bag in new condition. I put them on and immediately felt weird, but you eventually get over your loss of dignity, as everyone else owns a pair. When they‚Äôre new, they have these nubs that you put your feet onto that stab you with every step, but in a good way. Every other shoe brand says I‚Äôm a 9M, but Crocs think I‚Äôm a 10M, so make sure you get a size up for anything from this brand. There is no slip resistance, so watch yourself in the shower. The Off-road ankle strap seems durable and the whole shoe feels like it will hold up to any challenge. The top is flexible and will stretch.

  *I bought the charms separately on amazon; highly recommend(never too old for charms!!)**I normally wear a size women‚Äôs 9 (sometimes 9.5) but I bought a size 10. I ALWAYS recommend going up a size in crocs. These are not sneakers that need to be snug. You don‚Äôt want these to be tight at all! These are relaxing shoes. If they are snug, your feet will rub, get smelly, and create sores from the rubbing. And my foot just barely hangs over the edge when I bought a size 9 a while ago.They have a strap on the back to help keep your feet in place (I call that putting them in 4 wheel drive), or you can flip the strap to the front (shown in my picture). I prefer it that way because it‚Äôs easy to slide on and off like slippers.I personally wear this pair to work.I bought different colors for day to day wear.They are SUPER easy to clean! I typically use a disinfectant wipe; but you can use all purpose cleaner a towel, spray Lysol, wash them in the sink with dish soap, etc. But do NOT use bleach!

Surprisingly Great
",MIGirl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I didn‚Äôt want to love Crocs. They are so boxy and ugly, but that ugliness grew on me really fast once I started wearing them. I bought them because I needed gardening shoes. My other shoes were constantly having soil and other yard debris packed into the treads and it was way too much work to clean them out. So, I decided to give a pair of Crocs a try since with the holes they should get decent airflow and I could hose them off or toss them in the washing machine as needed. So, I reluctantly bought a pair of very purple Crocs.After a week of wearing my new Crocs, I can say I totally get why people love these things.They have NO arch support, which for me is generally horrible but they‚Äôre so roomy that it‚Äôs more like walking barefoot than it is like wearing bad shoes.With as roomy as they are, not at all form fitting, you‚Äôd think your feet would slip and slide all over the place and you‚Äôd have to work to keep them on your feet. But they don‚Äôt. My feet stay in place and the Crocs stay on my feet just fine.Nothing sticks to them. Dirt and soil get in through the holes, but also go right back out through the holes, just leaving behind dirty feet. And nothing has stuck to the treads: dirt, soil, mud, dog poop, compost‚Ä¶ nothin‚Äô. They also don‚Äôt stay wet long at all. I had to go out in the pouring rain and they were dry by the time I walked through my house.And, with all the holes, there‚Äôs great air circulation, just about as good as sandals. This was my first pair of Crocs; I doubt it will be my last. They‚Äôre too comfortable and convenient not to love them.

",Chazman1946,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  This is the second pair of Crocs I bought in the last month. Never owned a pair and always thought they looked ugly, and never understood why there was this attraction to them.I have wide feet, 12 4E, I was skeptical the 12 M size was going to be too tight.  They fit perfectly, I guess because they are wide to start off with, although if I had narrow feet I probably wouldn't be too happy with them.The things are super comfortable and around the house, I wear them with strap up front so I can just slip them off and on like a pair of slippers.  When I go out I wear the strap in the rear to secure them completely on my feet.They may not be the most beautiful pair of footwear, but I have worn them out dancing, even playing golf. They're great, that's why I bought this second pair.I was also skeptical about the little knobs on the inside of the shoe, but these I found kind of massage your feet and make them feel good.

Raised letters that say Hecho in Mexico on strap hurt the backs of my feet, this is new
",Aurora,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have been wearing crocs for years. I have had many pairs of this kind that I ordered. However, this time I bought them, I put them on, and wore them for a few hours. And I was like why are the backs of my ankles hurting? It felt like something was rubbing the backs of my ankles. I tried to ignore it, but ultimately I became worried it was going to rub the skin off my ankles so I took the shoes off and looked at them. The reason why the strap hurts is because it says ""Hecho in Mexico"" in RAISED lettering!! The letters on the inside of the strap are raised and keep rubbing the backs of my ankles as I walk. So I have concluded that the only way to wear these shoes safely is to move the strap from the back ankle area to the top of the shoe, which I don't like. Why did you have to do this, Crocs??? Please stop putting the raised letters of Hecho in Mexico on the inside strap because it hurts my skin. I want Crocs to stop making the shoes like this, because it sucks if my shoes hurt because of this. Why?? Please remove this lettering off the inside straps because you're causing pain to your customers.

They are quick and easy to dry after getting wet, can be worn with or without short socks, are very comfortable to walk in, cushioned and arch support.  Toe width has enough room for comfortable spread with no rubbing on sides or top of toes.  I wouldn't recommend any other shoe for Disney or for sore tired feet.  Just love them!

Not the nicest looking shoe but the most comfy.
",Hannah Lynn,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  As much as I'd love brown leather wingtip oxfords, they're impossible to find in womens size 5/6 in Wide Width. or anything nice looking for that matter. and I got tired of looking. When you have Cerebral Palsy, dressing is a struggle. I got to a point where I wanted something that I could put on without help, and comfortable with or without socks. Are they kinda ugly? Yeah. But it's worth it. I plan on getting two in black so they can blend in with my pants, but sometimes I enjoy colors. So far I own a Slate Grey and Navy. Both pairs were the right size (I ended up getting Womens 6. A little roomy but not too much, and i have tiny feet) Obviously they're snugger when I wear them with fuzzy socks.  These shoes are also great toe box wise. My heel is very narrow and my foot widens up to my toe box. The toe box is wide enough to where I don't feel squeezed at all, even with thick socks.When I'm travelling and the hotel doesn't have a shower seat I can wear these in the shower since I can't go barefoot. They are very easy to rinse out and dry.Even with my issue with dragging my left big toe, they're pretty sturdy. Most shoes after half a year would already have a hole and need to be replaced. I plan on getting second pairs just to have just in case, but I don't think my left shoes will wear through soon. They're not extremely supportive, I wouldn't recommend them for running, but as someone with chronic pain and weak ankle/foot muscles, these are great for around the house and walking through a bookstore.

Decent support for around the house

  I got these on a friend's recommendation after avoiding Crocs for years. I never understood what the hype was before, but my friend insisted that if I wanted something to support my feet while doing things around the house, these would be a good choice. I am glad I gave them a chance, and am now debating on getting a second pair for wearing out.While the arch support isn't spectacular, it's a massive step up from trying to shove insoles into slippers like I was doing before. They hold their shape well so far, they fit comfortably, have a little bit of shock absorption to them, and best of all they are EASY TO CLEAN! Also if you're a bit clumsy like me, the roomy toe area makes a great buffer to prevent you from injuring yourself by stubbing your toes.They fit very well without being too tight, and stay on my feet with or without the heel strap, so I've taken to keeping the strap folded up over the front to get in and out of them more easily.I'm definitely a fan now that I've tried them.

  Overall, I've been very happy with my Classic Crocs.  I wear a size 7.5 shoe and I own several pairs of Croc Flip-Flops/Sandals which I ordered in a size 8 (happy I did for those).  However, many have said the Classic Clogs run large.  After sizing my foot according to the chart it still said for me to order a size 8.  I went against that and ordered a size 7 based on the reviews saying they run large.  I'm so glad I ordered down a size! They fit how my normal shoe would because I do not like any loose feeling when I'm walking.  Even with my socks on they fit great and are surprisingly comfortable.  I can walk long distances without any foot fatigue.  Only minor negative I would say is my feet get warm in them.  I don't notice it until I sit down when having them on.  Other than that I'll definitely be purchasing additional pairs and love how easy they are to clean!

Heavenly Feel. Massages the soles of my feet and keeps them from itching.
",Synthia,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  My first pair of Crocs just arrived and after wearing them one day, I am in love!I got these shoes because my feet itch in other shoes during the summer time. The cloth interior  of regular shoes trap sweat and bacteria. It  is just not sanitary.I can wash, wipe and sanitize the inside of my Crocs every day if I want in order to avoid that issue.I intend to wear these barefoot, outside, after the shower and anytime I want because I can still keep them sanitary.Now, for the feel: Ooh, la la! I love the textured insides. The little raised bumps and spikes inside the shoes poke the bottom of my feet, giving them a massage and relieving tension when I walk. This feels so good!Often my feet are tired and stressed and I have to press them against something or do exercises to relieve them. But now, Crocs can destress my feet for me while I walk.Also, I like that I can wear the straps over the top of my feet like a slide-in slipper or behind my heel . It's so convenient to have two types of styles.  When I put the straps behind my heel, I can feel the spikes inside the shoes better so that is my preferred style after a long day.These shoes are very roomy. At first I thought they were too wide, but I like that there's so much room.The only concern was that one strap is a little looser than the other. Since most factories have standardization, I questioned whether I was sent a knock-off or the real thing. I hope these are real. Either way, they feel super good and I intend to get several pair.Now, let me get off the internet and go walk in my Crocs because my feet want to play!

Roomy Fit
",konmarikhadija,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  It doesn't say so on the description here but these crocs are labeled as 'Roomy Fit' so they are huge.  It's a little weird but it seems like Crocs fit differently depending on where they are made. I'm a 7.5 and initially opted for a 5/7 but found that it was too tight for my toes when I put the strap on the back of my heel. This was on a pair made in Mexico. However I have a 5/7 that was made in Vietnam that fit fine with or without the strap. So for this one I decided to order a size up to make sure that it will be comfortable no matter where it was made. The pair I received was made in Vietnam but since they are 'Roomy Fit' they are way too big. The color is gorgeous so I'm going to return these and order my regular size again and hope for the best.Update:I received the 5/7 today and they‚Äôre perfect! Leaving the review at 4 stars because it really should be in the description that these are roomy fit.

My go-to comfy shoes
",ResearchAddict,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Crocs were born in my hometown, well the town I lived in the longest, I should say. At first, I thought they looked hideous, kinda still do, to be honest. They make people's feet look huge. Yet, when I tried a pair at my daughter's house, because she insisted it was like walking on clouds, and I had a very sore, broken foot, I couldn't believe how comfortable they were. I began to sing a new tune! I became all about comfortable shoes. And this ics coming from a woman who's family owned several chains of shoes stores for 77 years! High-end fashion shoes, mid-range casual boots and shoes, and lower end shoes too. We never had anything like these in our stores though (they hadn't been invented yet). We did sell Jellies (remember those?) in the summer in the low-priced shops, but Crocs are so much nicer.I have owned and worn out 5 pairs of the classic Crocs in various colors, as well as 2 pairs of the winter lined ones. I just bought more classics, in more colors, because why not wear comfy shoes? I wear them gardening and when I'm being super casual. I keep a couple pairs as indoor slippers too. Will have to order a new pair for winter soon.

Good Buy!
",Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  A little about me so you can categorize my review:  I live in Hawaii where Crocs and Bermuda shorts are de rigueur.  I wear dress shoes at weddings and restaurants, but I have seen people wear them there without being asked to leave.I go through about 2 pairs a year (yes, Hawaii, ha ha).I actually expected to buy a pair at our local slipper shop where I normally get them, but I was shocked to find they had gone to $45/pair!  I whipped out my phone & showed the lady they are $26 on Amazon.  She smiled and said she would help me find a good fit so I could order from Amazon (Hawaii has pretty girls with pretty manners).I was apprehensive because of other reviews, but my pair fit as well as any, and the rubber seemed about average.  The toe box and width were a little more generous and the arch support was a little flatter, but overall, fit is as expected.  The tread on the new Crocs is more robust.  That is a plus for Hawaii because it rains everyday here, and slippery footwear are dangerous, especially on steps, sidewalks, and roads without dedicated walking paths.  My previous pairs were made in Mexico; these were made in China.  (Maybe these were made more with Haole feet in mind.)  The pic shows my existing (Mexico) Croc on the left, and the new (China) Croc on the right.Good: price, fit, wear, appearanceBad: (none)Summary: II like them. I am going to order another pair for our other house.-Larry

",dasn0wman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These guys are amazing.  For years, I avoided them despite of the hype some time ago.  The funny thing is that I was always looking for a shoe that can work as a slipper because that would be so practical for traveling.The regular clogs don‚Äôt have enough backing on the heel to be a shoe.  I got these slippers once and tried to use them as shoes but they have no soles and so very uncomfortable to walk on hard surfaces and got really wet when it was raining.  The soft shoes have too much backing on the heel and so cannot be used as a slipper.Enter the Croc‚Äôs innovative design that has a movable heel strap so it‚Äôs a slipper when you‚Äôre at home and a shoe when you‚Äôre moving around.In the picture, they look solid so you know they will work on hard surfaces.  My concern was if they are comfortable because it looks like hard plastic but it is really some rubber or silicone material so quite soft and comfy.The only thing is the sizing is off.  I wear 9.5 and got a 10 but I should have gotten a 9.  It is loose but not really an issue except if you plan to drive wearing them.  I have a manual car and I stalled the car when I drove it wearing these for first time.I don‚Äôt think looks is a problem and very subjective.  In this case, they become so iconically ugly that many ppl think they‚Äôre beautiful now.

  A friend bought me a pair, and I was HOOKED.  So I ordered this pair via Amazon in the Ice Blue color, in my normal sneaker-size women's US 7.  They fit true to size.  I'm so glad I discovered Crocs...  They are so comfy, light & airy, with great cushioning for walking all day long.  I used to think they were just plastic gardening shoes, or just comfy clogs for nurses & doctors.  But NOW I am seeing Crocs everywhere.... They have become a highly sought-after fashion item!  I also ordered the medium pink color (via Amazon), so now I have 3 pair of Crocs.  The bright fun colors make me smile, they are actually ""in fashion"" right now, and my feet couldn't be happier.PS... I advise to google them & check out the prices from various department stores, shoes stores, etc, & compare those prices with Amazon's pricing.  Although I must say this seller shipped pretty fast, had a competitive price, AND has the largest assortment of colors to choose from!  Great purchase.  -- Thank you :)

Needs a little break in time to get a great fit!
",ajk170,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Ok, so I never thought I would wear Crocs but after years and years of hype through movies, online, word of mouth, internet, and personal friends, I figure I'd try them.  And they were all correct! These really are great feeling things for my feet.  They aren't cool looking (at least not for an American non-hipster male) but boy are the nice feeling and functional. Specifically on function, I was looking for a camp slipper that I could slip on around the campsite/RV/Campground/lodge/cabin and walk outside without putting on boots or sneakers.  Sandals are ok if you're a boy or when on an island beach but anywhere else, nope.  Moccasins are ok, but typically they do not have a hard sole.  So camp slippers with hard soles are becoming a thing but they are typically over $80 and at that point they are just a really cheap boot.  So Crocs help fill the void and niche for a camp slipper.  Of course, Crocs are not insulated but inside I usually have socks on so these are perfect, esp in non cold months or climates because with socks or no socks I can slip the feet right into these things. And so far, without socks these things do not make the feet hot (at least not mine) so not a lot of foot sweat and the resulting stink.  What I have learned is that these things do stretch, at least a little which is good.  I ordered a size 9 ( i wear a 9.5 in boots/drewss shoes [Danner, Allen Edmonds, Sperry) and tennis shoes are a 10 [Nike, Adddis, Chucks]) and when they first arrived, the left one fit perfectly but the right one seemed a tad small since a couple of my toes were just barely bumping up against the front of the croc.  Plus I kinda thought my heals were right on the back edge of the croc but despite this , they were still pretty comfy but not great. Plus,the first few days of ownership and wearing without socks, the tops and sides of my feet were getting a few hot spots from rubbing. But nonetheless,  I continued to wear them and powered through hoping they would get better and rather quickly (within a couple weeks) with casual wearing these feel better (my right toes no longer barely touches the front and no hot spots) but I still feel like my heels are on the back edges of the crocks so I think they maybe too short.  But I really like that they fit snug and never feel like a flip-flop that could slide right off my feet, even when barefoot in them. Plus the nubs have a great massaging effect - super sensitive feet may not like it but the nubs are soft and with socks i can't feel them. But because of how good these feel, I want to believe the size 10 will feel better and as a result I have a size 10 on the way.If you can find these in the store, I would try on several pairs of the same size just to see if they fit slightly different due to variances in the QA/QC.  I think a person would be able to find the perfect fit in the store, esp. if they are between sizes like I am.  if my size 9 were just a tad larger they would be perfect.  As it is, I'm expecting the size 10 to be a little too big and slip around but I'm hoping they will work and not slide around but I expect them to feel just a little bit better, otherwise I'll stick to the smaller size due to a potentially better fit.

  I know, I know... they are the ""Given up on life"" shoe.  They are ugly as sin.  I know this.  But I also know that when I am in hour 16 of standing for the work I do, they are a lifesaver and I'm not thinking about my feet hurting.  I'm thinking about how much I doubt my career choice at that moment, but my feet are fine.  I'm thinking about crying as the sun is coming up and I still have another two or three hours to go, but my feet are good to go. And when I finally crawl into bed, every part of me is calling me names, but my feet are still my friend.Still not as bad as wearing slippers to the grocery store....

Better Than My Old Ones, But....
",HonestGuy3017,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are the genuine Crocs clogs, and are better than my old ones, which I purchased at a famous discount store chain. (Take a look at my photos.  Depending on what device you are using, the photos will show up in a different order.  I have two photos of the Crocs by themselves; one shows the excellent tread on the sole, and the other shows the bumps/points inside.  Two photos show the Crocs side-by-side with my old worn-out store brand clogs.)  But the Crocs are not an entirely unmixed blessing!  First, the Crocs cost over 3x the price of the chain store clogs.  Winner: chain store clogs.  Second, the Crocs are made in Vietnam,  while the chain store ones are made in USA. BIG win for the chain store clogs!  But the Crocs have advantages, too.  First, the Crocs fit as advertised. If you wear a size 11, order a size 11. (These do not come in Wide width. If you need a wider width, consider ordering the next 1/2 size up.  For instance, I wear a men's 10-1/2 Wide in a regular shoe. I ordered these Crocs in men's size 11, and they fit perfectly.)  The chain store clogs run small, so I had to get a size 12 of them. Winner: Crocs. Second, the Crocs sole has better tread and therefore better traction.  (See photos.)  Winner: Crocs. Third, the Crocs come with a strap that you can put around your heel to keep them from slipping off (see photos again).  If you don't want to use the straps, simply fold them up over the front, out of the way.  Winner: Crocs.  Fourth, Crocs have little buttons (or points) molded into the insole that massage the soles of your feet. This may or may not be an advantage, depending on your preference. Hint: if the points bother you, try wearing socks, or thicker socks if you're already using socks. For me, the points only took about 20 minutes of walking to get used to.  NO clear winner here; which is best depends upon your preference.  The Crocs appear well made, fit well, and are very comfortable. The next question for me is, will they outlast my chain store clogs long enough to justify spending more than three times as much money, for a foreign-made product?  The main reasons I bought these are: 1.  I could not get clogs in black anymore from the chain store.  They only come in an ugly brownish-green color that is patterned to look like dead leaves! (If you are a gardener who wants your shoes to blend in with your mulch, you might prefer the chain store clogs. Me, not so much!);  and 2.  I have always wanted to try the genuine Crocs product.  Time will tell whether they were worth the extra investment.

  Alright guys, I'll admit it....I've been out of the Croc game for a good while, now. I needed some comfy shoes to wear around the house and to the lake for boating/other activities where i could get my shoes wet and not sweat it. I used to wear these bad boys in high school non-stop (yep, you guessed it...graduated a virgin, but things took a turn for the better quickly after - MOVING ON! lol). Amazon was the only place that carried a 14 like my gargantuan feet need....so i copped em up on wardrobe, just because i was skeptical about falling back in to my old ways. Oh you best believe, the second i put them on i ripped up that return label! Who could deny their ugly, all-day comfort and goodness?!?! Long story, short....haven't stopped wearing them since. They gone from ""around the house and on the boat only"" shoes to ""fine dining, church, barbeque, errands, anywhere that would make my wife embarrassed to be with me, etc."" shoes. Currently, fearful that my wife is packing her bags....may be single and alone real soon, idk....but at least i'll be comfortable in my solitude, right?! 10/10 would recommend.

Lemon Yellow Crocs.... Now I own 3 pairs in 3 fabulous colors!
",T.H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I started with the electric pink color, then the ice blue, then a lighter pink, and now these sunny-cute Lemon Yellow ones.  I never thought I'd like Crocs, but OMG they are so comfy & so cute... I have officially fallen in love with Crocs!  I wear a women's size 7 in sneakers, so that's the size I buy in Crocs, and they fit me perfectly.  I have looked at the Crocs in the shoe stores, and these Crocs from Amazon are indeed the real deal -- and the price is the same on Amazon (sometimes even lower).... plus Amazon usually has a much better selection in available colors, too.  ------  I live in S Florida where it's almost always hot and humid, so my feet love the air conditioned holes in these shoes.  I have loads of sneakers, dressy shoes, and flip flops. But some days you just wanna wear something totally cute & colorful, and comfy.  -----  Btw...  I've noticed that Crocs have become VERY fashionable & ""on trend"" lately.  I see teenage girls & grown women rockin' them in all sorts of colors.  I'm really enjoying them, and so are my grateful feet.  I can wear them 24/7 and be so comfortable.  I've gotten so many compliments on the Lemon Yellow ones already, and that's from teens to women in their 30's, 40's, 50's and up!  Apparently everyone wants to own a cute pair of colorful Crocs these days.  --- This vendor mailed mine in a hurry & they arrived fast.  I definitely recommend Crocs, and this vendor on Amazon!  And PS... Fashionable guys are rockin' Crocs too these days, and in all the colors !  It's apparently the new big thing. :)

Great Shoe
",Hippy Woman,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I‚Äôm a size 7.5. The 8 is too big. The 7 had to be broken in for 2 weeks, because it was definitely a bit small at first and the outer edge almost touched the back of my foot.But here‚Äôs the thing about Crocs. If you get them too big, the arch support won‚Äôt work. Your foot isn‚Äôt supposed to swim in these. It‚Äôs definitely up to the user to decide their fit preference.As for my opinion: If you want a bigger fit, go a size (or in my case, a half-size) up.If you want a more ‚Äúcustom‚Äù fit, order true to size (or in my case, a half-size down) and break them in. The rubber loosens up a bit and conforms to your foot.I do think that this model of Crocs has gotten progressively smaller in fit over the past 4 years. So the Crocs of old are a darn sight bigger than today‚Äôs sizes.I have wide, duck feet, and the normal width was fine for me.The interior rubber ‚Äúspikes‚Äù inside have also gotten stronger and more effective. So much that it did take me a few weeks to break them in, because the spikes were QUITE spikey for my taste. It calms down after some wear.My husband couldn‚Äôt handle the spikes because he has soft feet with zero callus (lucky duck). So if you have sensitive feet, these might need to be worn with some socks until things soften up.

I checked the fit style on Crocs website before I bought- they have fit descriptions in each style of shoe which described the general feel and how ‚Äúroomy‚Äù or relaxed they are.These are the most roomy shoes they offer. I typically wear a 10.5 men‚Äôs, but usually need a wide size. I ordered the 10 size and these are a very comfortable fit. Plenty of room, without feeling too loose or like they‚Äôre going to fall off my feet.I wear these around the house for added support, and will wear them out fishing when the weather gets warmer.Tip: I have worn them with some thin socks and I find that keeps my meet foot bottom from getting sweaty in them.

  ¬†Ok ok, I know what you are all thinking... ""CROCS ARE SO UGLY THEY LOOK LIKE CLOWN SHOES!"" It is no secret that for years crocs have been violated for being big and a but um, unique to say the least but these shoes are super super comfortable! Staying home I realized my chanclas were not making the cut and decided to shop for new stay at home footwear, leading me to buying crocs. The ones in the video are ice blue, they are beautiful and comfortable! As someone with arched feet, you will not go wrong with purchasing these. After wearing them relentlessly for weeks it was super noticeable just how unsupportive other brands are with feet arches. Crocs though, they've got your back. They are of a rubbery plastic, so your feet will sweat at first, but after a while, at least for me, they'll stopped sweating. Overall this was worth the purchase since they serve as stay at home, out door and water shoes. They are true to size, however, you may consider sizing up if you want them to be roomy. Overall they're good. (as a size reference I used my Nike slides), I hope this helps!

  I made fun of my husband for wearing them but then I tried his and they seemed comfortable. Low and behold I got mine and these are glorious. I don't care if people think they are silly. I'm rocking them out because they work for what I need. These are like slippers but much lighter. I can slip them right on super easily. I can wear them with or without socks. When I want to go out to the shed outside or to the mailbox I just throw these on. If it's rainy outside, no prob! They stay on really well but if I need a little extra security I just simply throw the strap to the back around my heel and put them in what my husband refers to as four-wheel drive. Definitely recommend these but not if you're lame.

  I love the ones I bought several years ago. The problem is, the old ones are a very comfortable fit and say 45 on the bottom. The new ones say men's 11 which is supposed to equate to the European 45-46 so I assumed that they would be the same. they are visibly smaller and fit tighter. I may return them and get a men's 12. When I saw the Men's 11, I had reservations but figured the European number stamped into the shoe would be  a better gauge of size. Not so.

  Really great for the tropical areas of Hawaii.  Constantly getting these wet/ full of mud and rinsing them.  Also good for Hawaii because everyone takes their shoes of to go indoors - they slip on easily.  Not super comfortable, as people often say of Crocs, and not very supportive at all.  I might think of buying these again to wear in Chicago, because of ease of use, but not sure.  If you wear an 8 or 8.5, I'd definitely suggest following other reviewer's recommendations, and sizing up.  A 9 worked perfectly for me, but at first even the 9 felt a tiny bit short.  I think they do stretch, but like I said, I wore them constantly in wet weather, which I believe helps with the stretch.

Great deal on an extremely practical piece of ugly footwear!
",Laverne Otto-Phitre,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Rare to find this brand at the Amazon price I paid - wanted a clog with heel strap so I could safely drive back & forth to the local aquatic center.  I wasn't excited about the glossy black appearance, but since I only wear them to drive from my garage to the pool, walk about 200 feet across hot concrete, stick them in a locker while I swim, then reverse the process to go home, I can overlook my own fashion faux pas.  The heel strap keeps them properly positioned on my feet while driving, and the drain holes in the toes make them great for poolside.  I have falling arches & these make the walk from car to poolside & back so much less painful than foam flip-flops - and as stated before, I feel confident driving my car (automatic transmission) whereas with flip-flops, I'd change in & out of socks & shoes, while my kids wait for me to get the car started & the A/C going.  If these last half as long as my old Crocs Mammoth clogs (10+ years so far & still have a little bit of tread on the soles), then these are the best deal in footwear for my Fashion Tone-Deaf Curmudgeon Community.

Just purchased a gray pair for my husband, and they look really nice on me, too :)  Might have to order myself a pair of gray soon :)It fits perfectly, except the opening is a little bit smaller than the pairs I bought about 10 years ago.  Yes, I stocked up on them, back then, when I found the white ones locally.  BUT, the good news is, if I order a size larger, it's now a perfect fit.

  Who could say anything bad about a croc? It's one of those shoes where I feel like a significant number of people know what size they are in crocs, but just in case: I am usually between an 8-9 in shoes. These run about half a size larger, although I can wear both an 8 and a 9 in crocs, I like the way the 8 looks better. If you have wide feet and that's a deciding factor for you in getting the larger sizes, you don't have to worry about that because of the wideness of crocs. I'm so glad these are back in style. The white ones especially are a perfect staple shoe for summer. I wouldn't hike in them, but they would be fine as an everyday shoe for sure. They also make a good house slipper for going inside and outside too. we stan

They're so comfortable, supportive, light, and handy! I can wear them out to the garden and then just hose them off. They're quiet enough to wear around the house while the kids are sleeping.

  I have steered clear of buying crocs, as I assumed it would ""show my age"" but, having just turned 43, I think I no longer care. I am outdoors working in the yard many hours per day and my pale skin was cooking in my regular uncomfortable $4 flip flops. That, and needing arch support, my feet were aching. Now, my gorgeous grass green crocs protect my fragile skin. The crocs are SO comfy and sturdy I've begun wearing them on the regular for NON outdoor gardening and pool cleaning activities. Even as I precariously balance on the slippery rock formations around the pool, the crocs grip and keep me from sliding into the pool hilariously. 10/10 will buy more. Perhaps a rainbow version?

Must Buy!
",Tee H,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I was pretty skeptical about purchasing this shoe, due to the conflicting opinions in fashion.  What is more important, style or comfort?  Well, if you were to ask me that question two weeks ago, my answer would be style without a bit of hesitation.  However, after working eight-plus hour shifts, five days a week, standing only, my mindset ‚Äì and answer to that question ‚Äì has definitely changed.  I thought my Nike sneakers would cut it, but I soon realized they provided no support, no natural curvature for the foot to follow, no air circulation.  My knees and feet began to kill, and I decided it might be a good idea to do some research.Clogs.  Clogs?  I know I wanted more practical shoes, but clogs are just not suited for my nineteen-year-old self.  I mean, I still wanted something relatively cute.  But was that possible?  I kept scrolling through the shopping tab of Google, until I saw this pair of crocs.  Now, I remember I sported a bright orange pair in middle school, but I think I outgrew that stage.  Wait, they have a white pair.  Much more mature color.  I decided to take the risk, after all, my I owed it to my feet.Not only did these crocs pull my whole scrub uniform together ‚Äì I mean what screams healthcare more than scrubs and crocs? ‚Äì but I managed an entire shift with 99% less foot and knee pain than my previous sneakers had caused.  Another plus, they are ‚Äúnot only the most comfortable shoes, but also easy to clean just using soap and water and allowing for a quick dry.‚Äù  Because one of my duties as a pharmacy technician is to pour liquids, it is easy to spill on your shoes.  But, because of the synthetic material, I am able to grab a wet paper towel and wipe the mess right off.  But wait, there‚Äôs more.  I‚Äôm sure everyone can relate to their feet getting sweaty in sneakers, especially if you are moving around all day.  Well, crocs solve that problem for you.  The holes provide circulation and leave your feet as dry as ever.I totally agree with and support this review!‚ÄúThere is a moderate arch support. I have low arches and my sister-in-law has extremely high arches; neither of us feel like more support is needed‚Äù As arch support was one of my main concerns, I can assure that crocs also leave me feeling like my feet are supported properly. I highly recommend purchasing this product, as it has changed my work day experience.  I no longer suffer with severe feet and joint pain that is caused by flat shoes.

Excellent for pool deck, locker room, and at home!  Good arch support.
",Nina Jordan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Excellent sandal for walking on the pool deck and in locker rooms!  Good arch support!  Very comfortable. Easy to slip on and off while standing. Nice big toe box. I also wear them at home as slippers, as shoes in warm weather, on grass, on docks, and for canoeing, and kayaking. Lift your foot up and the water drains, out so your feet do not stay wet. On colder days I wear them with socks. I have worn them for many years and I keep buying more of same. Their usefulness and comfort wins out over lack of beauty due to bulky look. I hope they keep making this same classic sandal.  I have to replace them because extended wear on the pool deck concrete smooths the bottom making them slippery. Otherwise they last a long time. I wear them 5 or 6 days a week for hours at the pool while teaching swimming, life-guarding, roving, and while showering in locker room after swimming.

I LOVE MY CROCS.
",Rachel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I was so excited to get the cyan blue crocs on super sale. These are the comfiest shoes ever. The dots on the soles massage your feet, they provide great arch support, they‚Äôre such a cute color, and it‚Äôs finally long enough past the initial croc trend that they‚Äôre ironically stylish again. 10/10 recommend for beach days, days at the pool, rainy days, regular days, lazy days, winter days with socks, or whatever else to want to wear them with. They definitely run large, so try on a friend‚Äôs or try them on in the store first if possible. But snag yourself a pair, you won‚Äôt regret it!

These are now my favorite kick-around shoe - even went shopping in Walmart with them and they turned out to be comfy.
",S. Petty,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Where have these been all my life?  I first discovered a cheap copy of these at Walmart, and I loved how they fit and how easily they slip on and off.  So I was pleased to find the original brand here on Amazon.  I live in the desert, and our home is kept on the warm side too, so I definitely need models (like this classic model) with the holes in the side and top - the one thing I didn't like about my cheap knock-offs is they didn't have those holes, and my feet (with or without socks) were uncomfortably hot and clammy inside the house.  Another good feature is being able to toss the shoes into a bucket of soapy water to clean them after slogging in the mud outside.For me, the strap is crucial.  If I fold the strap up to the front out of the way, my heel sometimes slips out over the back end of the shoe, so I hope they never eliminate the strap!My feet are 11 1/2, and very wide (12 4E New Balance 408s fit well), and the size 12 Crocs fit good - I am going to try a size 13 next for kicking around the house and see if they are even easier to slip on/off.

  I know what you're thinking, these things are ugly and look ridiculous, and you're not wrong. What grown man would wear these. Well, turns out, this grown man would. When these things first hit the market, I was with everyone else making fun of them. But here's the thing, my brother is a cook, on his feet all day, and he wears crocks for cooks (don't worry, they're different than these, not open, so no foot fungus in your food) and he convinced me to try them because he swore they were the most comfortable pair of shoes he's ever had. So I finally broke down and bought a pair, and you know what, he was right. These things are great. I slip them on when I've got errands to run, light yard work, or sometimes when it's nice, just out and about, and they are very comfortable, and durable too. Get em wet, no problem, wear them with or without socks, still comfortable. Yes I look like a goof with them on, and I thought that would bother me, but it turns out my sense of shame is way lessened by how comfortable they are. If I thought I could get away with it, I'd wear them everywhere during the warmer months.

Great fit and fun color
",Stephanie H.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  My old crocs finally came apart after many years of use, and I decided to invest in another pair to wear to the pool and around the house. These fit just like my old ones. They are snug enough to stay to on without the back strap down and loose enough in the toes to be comfortable. The nubby inside is not really uncomfortable, but not as nice feeling as a smooth insole would be. On the other hand, my bare feet would stick to a smooth plastic sole. . I do like that I can put my wet feet into them when I get out of the pool and I don't slip around in them. I love the color (turquoise)! While crocs aren't really a fashion statement, they are ok for a quick, casual trip to the grocery store or the postoffice. I'm happy with my purchase.

",Matt,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Crocs are not the fashion statement of the decade, this is true. However(!), their staying power has everything to do with how functional and durable they are. Going out to get the mail, take out the trash, quick walk with the dog, they are quick on/quick off and more comfortable than they should be.Mine kept disappearing so I bought my wife her own pair. Problem solved. Sidenote: Mine are probably 6 years old and have been used far, far harder than any pair of shoes should be. They have paint on them, gouges from who knows what, are faded and don't look very good at all, but they strap is still completely intact and they are still very comfortable. I keep waiting for them to die so I can spring for new pair but they just keep going.

But maybe your old ones wore out and you're at the everything for $5 store and you buy the crappy ones, and you just end up forgetting how great and different real crocs are. If you need extra room in the toe area to use toe separators, or you have wide feet, and/or you have some foot issues with pain, CROCS can be a saver for your feet.

  I've always made fun of crocs. Several years ago, I began to see their utility when it comes to camping. They are lightweight, easy to put on, easy to wash off, and most importantly... compatible with thick socks. But I still didn't buy myself a pair.I've been through 2 or 3 pairs of Croc Sexii flip flop sandals in the last few years, and I love them.So when Halloween rolled around last year, instead of ordering or making some silly one-use shoe covers for my Untitled Goose costume, I bought some bright orange crocs. It took a while to get used to the feeling of my foot being encased by solid plastic, but they're pretty comfortable.I had 2 pairs of flip flops break recently, and my crocs have since become my house shoes. Also one of my younger co-workers (who is all about fancy sneakers) is now wearing white crocs n socks to work every day, so... maybe they are cool now? Maybe?Also I ran a mile in them once at the end of a 5k fun run.

  I purchased these for easy slip ons to go outside with my toddler.  We are usually in our backyard playing with water.  THESE ARE AMAZING FOR THAT!  I am so happy I joined the crocs club and I can't believe I didn't join the club sooner.  Below are the pros for these:1. They are great for people who have wide feet (like me)2. Perfect for easy slip on and run outside.3. Great for the beach, pool, any water activity.4. You can easily slip them on and/or you can put the back strap down and your foot is a little more secure.5. Easy to clean - If you have a colored pair (like me) and they get a little dirty you can use soap and water rub on them and they look brand new again.Cons -1. If you bend your foot and/or crouch down they can leave a little crease in the shoe.

  I‚Äôm a late adapter to Crocs.  Arrived yesterday.  Initial reaction was the shoes were too long and wide, so I reluctantly put them back in the bag and started to return them.  Something urged me to actually try them on again.  I used the heel strap, walked around the house, then the yard, and next thing I knew, I wore them the rest of the day and long into the night. Eventually, I tried them without the heel strap and found they were just as secure and comfortable. I canceled the return request.

  Use a Dremel type tool with a 1/2"" diameter coarse sanding drum to carve out a relief for a plantar wart- otherwise the ""nubs"" inside will greatly pain you!  (See pic of hacked Croc)The soles on my 2018 vintage classic style Crocs wore out relatively quickly and these 2020 ones are of the same design and appear to be of the same material.  Once the treads are worn away, they are REAL slippery on smooth wet or merely damp surfaces.  I used the above Dremel rig to cut new grooves as treads in my old ones.Without socks, your feet will sweat a good deal, or at least it is more noticeable to me.  I just slip then off if I am stationary, so,  driving is the only time it bothers me- YMMV..Overall, they are a great value unless you go with sandals.

Fabulous replacement for my 13 y.o. Crocs Original Clogs
",allison_m_funkonovo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are a fabulous replacement to my original Croc clogs from 2006. The fit is more streamlined than my old pair. Not as wide from side to side. No pinching, slipping or stubbing. The ice blue color is exactly as pictured. It's not Turquoise or Aqua Marine blue. I wear size 8 medium (a 6 medium in mens). This clog is unisex. So glad I didn't have to buy them more expensive elsewhere. If you have very wide feet, I would consider ordering a different Crocs clog. Did I mention how comfortable and supportive they are? Important for bad backs, necks, foot problems. I wear mine as house slippers.

Shoulda listened to hubby years ago about these Crocs
",Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  So my husband has been trying to get me to buy a pair of Crocs for years. He practically lives in his. I just couldn‚Äôt get past the looks of them. Well I finally gave in and bought this pair. Oh my what have I been missing? They are so comfortable, and easy to slip on. You can get them as dirty as you want in the garden and then you just wash them off.  They provide good air flow so your feet don‚Äôt get sweaty. What more could you want in a pair of shoes? Ok so I probably couldn‚Äôt get away with going to a wedding in them, but wish I could, cause I‚Äôd have the most comfortable feet on the dance floor! I love my Crocs and are starting to actually think they‚Äôre kind of cute. I shoulda listened to hubby years ago!

  I was worried based on some of the reviews. But I‚Äôm happy with the purchase. My daughter loves them. And they fit her perfectly. He typically wears a 8.5.

I bought some croc charms from amazon as well which were affordable and fun to place on her new shoes. Will buy another pair for sure.

Must have investment for any wardrobe and feet care/relief
",Kate M,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are so so comfortable - as recommended.  A great purchase and investment for any person.  I would and will buy more.  I was given a word of mouth recommendation for Crocs from a woman with feet problems from years of work on her feet.  I hesitated at first thinking do I need these given flip flops, sneakers etc.  I was not prepared for the little massage/stimulation like nodules inside which are great too.  I can't think of how anyone would not get a lot of wear and relief out of these shoes, particularly anyone who works on their feet.  At the moment working in long shifts on concrete these are like a little foot massage and relief in between.  TRUE TO WEBSITE IMAGES FOR SLATE PURCHASE.

  Yes, I used to hate these and thought they were the ugliest shoe ever. Swore in high school that I would never get a pair. I‚Äôm now 26 and now that I‚Äôve hit my quarter life crisis, I found myself ordering a pair. Saw my hubby wearing them and made fun of him every time I saw him wear them. Then one day I needed to put them on to grab something outside (seeing that those were the only ones near me lol). He is a size 12 and I‚Äôm a size 6.5 so you can only imagine how huge they felt. I saw the light that day and ordered a pair of crocs.ANYWAYS here‚Äôs what you ladies wanna know about the fit:- I‚Äôm a NARROW 6.5 in women (can fit 6 in heels and 7 in Nike‚Äôs)- the site says to size up if you are a half size BUT these are already ugly enough so I took my chances and sized down.- ordered a 6 in women (Army Green) and they fit PERFECTLY.- the shoe feels SLIGHTLY tight when I put it in ‚Äú4x4 mode‚Äù (as my hubby calls it lol) but it‚Äôs not enough to bug me.- hubby says they stretch out over time so there you go.I got these the day they were expected and I unfortunately have not worn any other shoe since receiving it.

Comfort! Ventilation! Durability!
",Edwin Anthony Aurelio,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  The Classic Clog line of Crocs serves my needs perfectly.  I can no longer wear normal shoes because my feet require more oxygen than those of most people, but I hate slippers and sandals (or going barefoot).  The Crocs Classic Clogs provide the ventilation I  need while still feeling like shoes, they're also very comfortable with cushioning thick soles and they're durable, lasting for a long time with no damage even after 3 years of daily use.  They're also cheap compared to others.  Yes, they're ugly, but you can get them in pretty colors to compensate, like these bright yellow ones.  For die hard Crocs fans like myself, buying one pair may lead to buying a dozen or more so be warned.  Emphasis on Classic Clog line.  The other models of shoes Crocs makes provide less ventilation and my feet aren't as comfortable in them.

Treat yourself to another Croc color.
",Amazon CustomerJim,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Great house slippers. Just read reviews that mention this. I wear a 10  EEEE, so these were perfect. I ordered the 10, and the classic crocs width was an excellent fit. If you have a narrower foot, D size and below, check out reviews on other Croc models that are narrower. Just pay attention to the number of reviews that mention whether the length is too short, this you may have to order one size larger, but the decrease in width should not be a problem for those with narrow, D and bellow. Crocs are so comfortable and easy to slip on and off I ordered another pair. And because they come in so many colors, you can order another color that pleases you, something to treat yourself to, as they are reasonably priced. Amazon‚Äôs selection is hit or miss, with many selections not available in all sizes and colors. So try Zappos. Amazon owns them anyway. And they always have free shipping and free returns.

Love My Orange Crocs
",Lindy68,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  This is my first pair of crocs; never had the desire to own any. But now, can't imagine being without them! I needed something easy to slip into and take off when I'm down at the horse barn, feeding and cleaning corrals. Also nice that they are waterproof, unlike my old leather clogs. Excellent price, too . At first, I thought they were going to be floppy on my feet; I did purchase the size I usually wear. I wear socks with the crocs, sometimes two pair in the cooler months. They still fit just fine. I have narrow to medium width feet, wear a size 10. I like the orange because they're easy to spot wherever I've left them. Easy to clean off the dirt, either brush off or hose off; I understand they can be thrown in the washer, too. And, best of all, these crocs are as comfortable as my slippers I wear around the house. Sometimes, I forget I wore my crocs in the house, noticing sometimes hours later! Love them! And convinced my husband to order some, too! He loves his, too!

Completely Croc-ish
",Thomas K. Seibold,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  You know the drill--They're comfortable but so unstylish that they're stylish. Well, I don't think this classic style of Crocs will ever be stylish, to my eye, but we buy them for comfort and versatility, right? My old pair were so worn that they started to slip on wet surfaces so I knew it was time for replacement. These fit well, though the rear strap is now tighter than the originals I got 15 years ago. The upside is they'll stay on better than the old ones--the downside is that if you plan to use the strap, you'll have to reach down and use a finger to stretch it around the back of your foot. It's fine--just different than the old looser strap.

  I was going to buy slippers to wear in my yard and patio since it's been annoying to put shoes on whenever taking my dog outside or to take the trash out. But I went with Crocs since they are just as comfortable while also allowing me to run around if needed (ie. dog randomly feels like running around the backyard).It does its job and is comfortable enough. If anyone thinks Crocs are ugly or think they are bad purchases, they should relax. They're functionally great the way one would wear ""fat pants"" or an old t-shirt around the house.

I gave in!!!!
",David R Morales,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I never thought I would ever own a pair but I gave in after my sister bought some. Keep in mind I made fun of her for wearing them because I didn‚Äôt understand what the hype was about. But honestly after trying hers on they where so comfortable and I just had to own a pair. I love all the colors and they are great for around the house and walking my dog, especially after a long day at work wearing my flats. Trust me if you are having second thoughts about these you need to try for yourself. The fit is great too! I‚Äôm a solid women‚Äôs  7 1/2 and I purchased a women‚Äôs size 8. My foot fits perfectly inside and they are wide so your foot feels free inside. The heel of my foot has a little room from the back of the shoe. I was worried about that but from what it seems if you‚Äôre a half size get the next size up!

",Vuong Ly,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have to be honest. I've never been a fan of the way Crocs look and have never given it a chance. I added this to my dad's collection of shoes for him to pick from. He suffers from gout so I've been buying tons and tons of shoes, trying to find him the perfect pair to alleviate the pain as much as possible when he walks. I have to say, these are quite comfy. They're waterproof, super flexible, and made of great material. I won't deduct any stars for the looks since it's a subjective matter. While these are not my dad's go-to shoes, they definitely surprised me at how nice they feel. My dad fits a size 9 and the shoe itself is true to size.Value 5/5 *****. Comfort 5/5 *****. Fit 5/5 *****. My Recommendation 5/5 *****.

Crocs Classis Clogs are the best for summer
",JLee,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I love the class Crocs clog.  My feet swell in hot, humid weather, and these are the only shoes I can tolerate.  I also walk several miles a day to and from work, and these are the best.I buy wear a size six-and-a-half, and I order the Crocs in size seven to give my feet room to swell.  In cooler weather, I wear socks; hot weather, no socks.  Also, putting the strap on the back of my heel holds them on when my feet aren‚Äôt swelling.  When they swell, I push the strap up to the top of the shoe.They provide excellent arch support.  I have very high arches and a very high instep and I am very comfortable in these shoes.The main drawback is that if it is raining and you walk into a store with smooth floors, swoosh, slip, slide.  You have to be very careful.  Usually, there is a mat to wipe your shoes at the entrance.  Use it.Also, I have a friend with MS who tells me these shoes do not provide enough lateral support, so if you are unfortunate enough to share that need, these shoes are not sufficient.  For everyone else, they are terrific, very, very comfortable.You can wash your Crocs, best to use a damp cloth, but you can put them in the sink if they get filthy.  Most of the time, an occasional swipe along the inside with damp cloth or paper towel is all you need to prevent them picking up odors.  If they start to squeak, put some vegetable oil on them overnight and then wipe them off in the morning with a paper towel.If they are too big, put them in the dryer with a damp towel for a few minutes.  If they are too small, do the same, but take them out and put them on and walk around in them to stretch them.

Misleading Images
",Will,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I ordered the 'Pepper' colored classic clog. The pepper color that was advertised in the images was this blueish blackish shade croc sort of like the navy color that is advertised but a shade lighter. The actual pepper clog is a bright red croc, but not necessarily neon red its kind of like the color of a pepper. I'm not really upset with the actual croc but more so that I didn't get the product that was advertised by the images. So I guess buyer beware and look up the colors on google images beforehand to make sure that you're getting the color you actually want. I'll add more to this review if there are any further issues down the line.

  I bought for my daughter because she works retail and they stand all day. The first time she wore them to work, she texted me and said her feet was comfy. I was so happy because my child is so picky and particular on everything.  She wears a 8 and that's what I bought and she said they didn't really slip off... So I think that means because she was wearing socks, she didn't feel the slipping and she said she changed from sports mode back to non-sport throughout the day. She said she mostly wore sports mode because she walks alot on her job.

  If you ever have to go up a half size (especially for sandals, or fear that the back of your heel will hang), just order the next size up. I am glad that I did, as these fit my feet perfectly, with little to no room once I push my feet all the way in the shoe. I would imagine that had I ordered a size down, these would have been a horrible fit. (Normally can order down on tennis shoes and they fit fine).These were a little wide, but  I sometimes feel that's how CROCS made them to either feel/fit. I think they are the perfect outdoor shoe for rainy weather. The Lavender was an excellent color choice. I would highly recommend these shoes to anyone.

I think it took awhile to get used to the feeling of this type of shoe also. So far I am loving them. I also noticed that all of the cracks I had around my heels and the ball of my feet are now gone. They are completely healed in just a few weeks that I have been wearing these. I have used so many lotions etc with no success and wearing these shoes for just this short time took them away. I don‚Äôt understand how but that is an amazing bonus. for anyone that has experienced painful, cracked skin on your feet you will appreciate these. Wow is all I can say!!

  I destroyed my ankle 3 years ago and have been living in chronic pain ever since. I've tried everything known to man. Even those super expensive shoes where they scan your foot. And yet still, pain. Working on my feet for 12+ hours a day didn't help. I came home every night a cripple. There have been days I have crawled from my car to my door. I've worn crocs every day for a solid week and it has been the first week since my accident that I have been almost pain free. I wear these suckers hard. Working 12+ hours in a hospital, on a concrete floor, running around like a chicken with its head cut off- AND THE CROCS MADE IT.

  Crocs are not going to get you noticed by the opposite sex, but they are comfortable and they last forever. Whether you are going to the grocery store, the garden, or the pool, you can't go wrong in Crocs. My kids are even asking for Crocs now, so I guess they are cool again. So, no worries if you buy them and they are not cool....just wait a while and they will come back in style. If they get dirty, hose them down.

  You either love or hate these types of shoes. I'm a fan of them, and they're especially useful for quick visits outside or around the pool.

",Jared Davis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Honestly, I never thought in a million years I would wear Crocs, let alone actually enjoy wearing them. They are actually a daily driver in my shoe repertoire. I pretty much only wear them around the house but for a house shoe, they are just too comfortable to give up. It's been around 9 months since I got them and they are holding up amazingly well. I still wear them around the house daily. One con I can give them is that you HAVE to wash them at least weekly otherwise they will absolutely reek. I'm not sure what causes it since my other shoes don't smell at all but these get ripe really easily.The shoe, in general, is bigger than what the packaging says just because they make the width a little bigger so make sure to measure your foot (there are guides out there to figure out your croc size) before you buy.

  Crocs are dorky but keep your feet cool, great on wet days, very comfortable, easy to get on and off and last.Although I swore I wasn't going to buy shoes on the internet due to the hassle of getting a good fit, I did it again. Even with free returns a one hour shoe buying trip can take weeks to get the size right online due to the shipping back and forth. Why did I do it? Crocs closed all of their retail stores near us. I tried looking in the larger retailers that Croc says carry their shoes and found that they didn't!These were to replace an identical pair I've owned for 6 years. The tread was gone so it as time. I checked the reviews and the Amazon shoe sizer and decided to go 1 size smaller than my old pair which were comfortable but a little large. Not knowing whether Crocs had changed/improved the last for their shoe after a few years even getting the same model can be a guess on size. These are also comfortable but the smallest Size 11s I own. Overall I'm happy.

  i wear a 10.5 shoe- ordered these in a 10 and they fit pretty boxy and loose. i left them out in the sun for a while until they had shrunk up enough to fit perfectly (shrunk in both width and length).wearing them with socks isn‚Äôt comfortable bc the material pulls your socks all over the place but they‚Äôre great barefoot- perfect for trash runs, taking the dogs out, after mountain biking- however, i could never imagine wearing them in public.

  Great shoes, fit as expected. This is the second pair we've purchased, comfy, convenient (really ridiculously convenient) and great for nature walks/river days!I started using my crocs as water shoes on accident, on that day I discovered that my crocs were wildly better water shoes than my actual dedicated water shoes.Weird, but awesome. I couldn't kick them off of my feet as hard as I swam, and they did a great job protecting my whole foot in the river. Highly recommend!

  I'm on my fourth pair in this style and love these Crocs. I wear them every day around the house. Three pairs I bought  a size larger and I feel like I'm not wearing shoes.

Wore out my old pair, new pair is stiff because they need to be broken in
",JeriOwl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  The longer I wear each pair of Crocs the more comfortable they become.  I've worn many different styles and colors of Crocs, the khaki classic clog is my timeless favorite for most every season but bitterly cold.  They are ideal for every day wear around the home or town, at the pool or even for basic farm chores. Fit is always true to size but be forewarned, black tends to shrink in sunlight whereas I've never encountered this problem with other colors.

I wanted to find these classic ones because I loved to wear them around the house as indoor slippers
",Ryan,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I couldn't find the classic ones in the stores around where I live anymore. They all have adopted the newer hard bottoms. I wanted to find these classic ones because I loved to wear them around the house as indoor slippers. Just for some context, I'm Asian, and we don't wear shoes into the house. Partially to keep the floors clean, but probably some other cultural reason that I haven't looked into yet. We have specific indoor slippers. I haven't looked too much into slippers, but I know these are good in the winter time because they can keep my feet warm and are easy to wash if they start to smell.The only problem I have with these are that it's hard to know what size to buy without trying them on, but that's just me.

  I have a very old pair of Crocs that are the MOST COMFORTABLE shoe ever. In this time of Covid I wear them a lot. In fact I wear them most of the time. They were wearing out and I decided to order another pair. This new pair is fine really but nothing like the just soft enough, just firm enough old pair that I still have. I slip my feet into that old pair and my feet stop barking and start purring. They are a treasure. If my life was a nation they would be a National Treasure.So I was very sad that these new ones were not exactly like my old ones. If you didn't have my old ones to compare to you might not know what you were missing. I did not post a review at the time of purchase as I was too busy worrying about Covid and life and survival.

  I have held an anti-Croc position with much color and fanfare, for years now. Making fun of them and the wearer whenever I could. Then I finally got a pair two weeks ago. And not just any pair, bright yellow. If I'm gonna hate on Croc's why not do it loudly. I just so happened to be on vacation last week, which required 10+ miles of walking per day. I wore them like my life depended on it. And alas, I find myself begrudgingly a fan. They are really well designed, so simple, but so effective. Everywhere slippers, and when I say everywhere, that includes lobster boats, scaling the rough coastline of Maine, walking endless long dirt roads, outdoor showers on the beach.

That said, how hard is it to take them off? They do what they are supposed to.A word to the wise: Do not leave your Crocs out in the sun. They will shrink.

So I swallowed my pride and got me some crocs.OMG I sleep in them. They have become my work shoes- I paint in them, climb on the roof with them, garden in them, and cook in them. Why have I just now discovered Crocs?!?My friends make endless fun of me. They send me croc memes. I don‚Äôt why they are so tickled at my crocs, but they don‚Äôt know what they are missing. One day they‚Äôll wish they were like me, and had their own.

LOVE THEM SO MUCH but slightly big
",Jenny,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I literally LOVE crocs so much. I bought a grey pair last month and having looked back since. They are slightly wider and larger than the normal shoe but it‚Äôll be great for the winter and thick socks. You do have to get used to the little beads on the bottom of the croc but honestly soooooo comfortable. Btw sport mode all the way. Get yourself a pair and be ready for the judging comments. Don‚Äôt worry, it‚Äôll be worth it.

  I wear these around the house b/c I have high arches and am not supposed to go barefoot very much. They don't have much arch support, so I added felt arch cookies and now they provide better support. They're a little loose but I like that, since I'm using them as house slippers.

Great fit, very comfortable
",D. Yauch,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I normally wear size 8.5. Usually when I get footware such as this they only come in whole sizes, so I have to choose between 8 and 9 (US). My experience has told me to go with the 8 (flip flops, muck boots, etc). It held true for these, I ordered the size 8 and fit is just what I wanted. Overall love the design, there is a bit of arch support which I want, very comfortable. I wear these as ""house slippers"" all the time I'm in the house, I live on a farm and wear boots most of the time outside, so out in the garage I leave these while stepping into my boots, and vice versa. I probably wouldn't wear these out anywhere, but you certainly could. I don't use the straps, just leave them in the out of the way position, forward, but if I did wear them any place but in the house I'd probably engage those straps.

Best Shoes Ever
",Taylor Becker,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I had a pair of Crocs as a kid, but never got another pair once I grew out of them. Like so many, I fell into the ""Crocs are the worst"" mindset (where it's fashionable to hate them). Having a two year old, I was looking for a pair of slip on shoes that were more comfortable than flip flops. After hours of searching, I remembered my childhood Crocs and decided to give them a chance and I'm SO glad I did. I don't even care that they look a little silly (but really not bad!) because they're so stinkin comfortable. Now I can slip them on to play outside with my daughter, run to the store, or play in the lake. They're awesome!

Lightweight easycare slip ons
",Sue Woods,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I work as a volunteer with puppies, with a hygiene routine that requires me to change footwear inside and outside their pens. These are perfect for the job, being (very) lightweight, easy to disinfect and slip on and off. The back strap is useful to give added security if needed. I am an 8 1/2 (US), 39 Eur or 6.5 UK and I bought a size 9. They are easy to wear and keep on, particularly with socks, and I'm not swimming in them, as I had feared I might be.

Great for gardening & around the house
",jellybean,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have worn these since I got my first pair for 50¬¢ at a garage sale! The price on Amazon was not quite that good, but it was on the low side. I did have to return mine though because my size was not available in my desired color of khaki. Zappos had them (free shipping and free returns). As always, Amazon is my first choice, but even having to pay $6 more on Zappos.com I got the color I needed. Crocs sizing can be confusing: the bottom of each shoe list two sizes:  M (men) W (women). So when looking for your size, look for your gender size. The shoes should fit roomy at the toe and at the heal - do not let them rub anywhere (as advised by crocs). You will get used to the loose fit after a while - or just use the back strap for more stability. I ordered M 8/ W6 and it was to small (short: toe & heal touched ends) My normal shoe size is women's 8 and on rare occasion 8 1/2. My foot is narrow to med. width. The size I needed from crocs was M7/W9 (so the women's 8 was too small/short). Amazon showed my size of US7/9 (way down at the bottom of the scroll down drop-list), but did not have my color available. Thought I'd take a chance (to save $6) and try women's 8. Zappos, like Amazon, delivered quickly and the shoes in the proper size 7/9 fit!

  I returned the first pair of Crocs (unisex) that I purchased because they were ginormous. They were not only large but very wide. That said, they felt good on the sole of my arthritic feet. I went on-line again & search for a pair that was described as ""women's"" because other reviewers stated there was a definite difference in the width, ie, women's were narrower. Not so. These are just as wide. I normally wear Danskos so I'm accustomed to a shoe that fits loosely but I feel I could almost get both feet in one Croc.If you have wide feet, order the B(M)--Do NOT size up.

  Technically, these were a gift to someone else.

And the covered toe keeps them from catching is things ((which is always *my* problem with flip-flops - the toes catch and I trip)).  The back-strap is optional, but there if one needs it.

  These are the old original Crocs they've been selling for many years now. It was about 4-5years ago when they started making some newer Crocs with a newer type of plastic, I've bought a few pairs of those and they've all had problems with shrinking, which eventually causes them to rub and blister your foot in different places, to be expected when you buy shoes that fit, which then proceed to shrink! Don't know why they sell those ones, the material is clearly defective imo. These originals might wear out a little quicker but they're comfortable and don't shrink.

  I originally purchased these for my girlfriend for Christmas. We use Crocs to go kayaking in since they're rubber and clearly don't hold water. The only downside to using these for something like kayaking is that when the surface you're stepping on is slick, don't expect Crocs to have a firm grip - they'll make you slip easily (only downside but not enough to give 4/5 stars). We also wear crocs to go out in the spring time when the yard is just mud. That way, we can just hose the crocs off and our feet off before we go back in the house.I ordered the size shoe she usually wears and it fits her perfect without any issues.

I have to find a solid object (wall, stair tread, post, etc.) to stop the shoe from sliding.Trying to 'slip into' them with socks on is double-hard, since the socks snag on the little dimples, which makes the shoe slide forward that much easier.

Crocs Rock!
",Edna W.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I absolutely LOVE the Crocs classic.  They are basically all I wear, whether I'm at work, going to a wedding (YES), gardening, at the beach, I mean:  once you go Crocs, you never go back!!!I have a C width foot, which is just a tad wider than what the shoe industry considers ""normal"" (namely a B), yet really it is right in the middle of the width spectrum.  I love that the Crocs Classics are the perfect width for me.  I love how much cushioning is between the sole of your foot and the sidewalk or whatever you are walking on.  I love that, years ago, they cured my plantar fascitis or whatever it was that caused my feet so much pain for so long--GONE, once I started wearing Crocs Classics (which were then called Crocs Caymens, but I digress--same shoe).  I love how long they last.  They are my favorite shoe on this or any other planet.

These Deserve More Than 5 Stars!
",Ananda,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are the most comfortable shoes you could buy! I read mixed reviews about them and was a little worried about how they would fit considering I stuck to my actual size and didn‚Äôt go up/down a size. I‚Äôm a size 8w and ordered just that and they fit me perfectly!!! I also read how some people received fake ones but the ones I got are the real deal. I compared them to my friends crocs and lucky me, I received the real ones. As soon as I got them I wore them out to the store and the arch support is perfect for me because I have flat feet and wear arch supporters in my sneakers anyway. The fact they have arch support makes them 10/10!  I definitely see myself ordering more and more!! If you‚Äôre thinking about getting these, just do it! You will not regret it I promise you.

Comfort Over Style!
",LDK,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I know this fad is probably already over, but I just decided to finally buy a pair in anticipation of a cruise. I'm not crazy about the texture that you put your feet on (a little spiky), but I got used to it. I am picky about my footwear, and there are few things I can wear without the soles of my feet hurting. These things are SO comfortable! They are super lightweight and seriously the only footwear I needed for the entire week on the cruise. I wore them in the room, walking around the ship, walking around ports, to the beach, to the pool, and even to dinner. The last is maybe not recommended, but you can definitely get away with it. :) I even tried to continue wearing them once I got back to the Minnesota snow (although that did not work out so well). I like the black color because they blend in a little bit more than the brighter colors. They do get crease marks on the top of them, but there's not really a way to prevent that. You might lose a few style points, but they are so comfortable you will not even care!

",Lauri S.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are GREAT. Don't know why I resisted getting crocs for so long... I guess I thought they were ugly, but man, are they ever comfortable!! And I've gotten to the point in my life where comfort trumps style. (That being said, they aren't THAT ugly... Or maybe they've just grown on me!) I had an old pair of slides that I used for quick indoor/outdoor shoes (to take out the trash, etc.), but they developed holes in the soles, and needed to be replaced. These fit the bill perfectly! I can quickly slip them on to go outside, then slide them off in my foyer when I come back inside (especially with the strap swiveled up an out of the way, they function like clogs).They fit as expected (sizes run true).

Great Shoes!
",Amazon Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I love my crocs. I bought them to have an easy pair of shoes to slip on when going around my dorm building and they are perfect! They are amazing. Just be aware that if you for whatever reason may want the back support in the back and not the front that they may be a little tight. I personally do not wear them that way but when trying them out I figured out they were a little snug on my feet if the back part was in the back and not the front.

Comfy but runs small
",A. Russell,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Love Crocs sandals. They're super light weight and fairly durable considering they're just made of foam. They're some of the more comfortable sandals I own, since they have some arch support and whatnot in them. I still couldn't wear them for a whole day, or even several hours at once, but for brief periods, like to run outside or wear at the beach, they're great. I only have 1 complaint, they tend to run about 2 sizes too small. I wear a 9- 9.5 regularly, but had to order a 12 in Crocs so they'd fit comfortably.

  The Croslite Polymer rubber-like material is extremely soothing to your feet. I use these as slippers indoors. They keep your feet cool in the summer and warm in the winter. As soon as I walk in the door, I step into these. These shoes RELAX your feet big time! You can wear the strap in the front or the back. I wear it in the back to secure my heel. You can also use them at the beach to protect your feet from glass, rocks, & sea weed. These Crocs are the first item I put in my suitcase no matter where I'm going. You can throw them in the washing machine and they quickly air dry. You can also hose them off. They are my 2nd feet! I wear them all the time I am inside my house (except when I'm sleeping) because they feel so comfortable. These Crocs last for years!

",KING OF NEW YORK HACKS,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Fits well, first time Crocs owner so will try to do an update in a month or so after they are broken in. After reading the reviews I was hoping for American made but got ""Made in Vietnam"". Other sites said that's a good thing, we shall see. So far they fit perfect, a little room for the big toe and both my feet are surprisingly comfortable being they just came out of the bag. Feels like a slipper and the motion of my feet react just like they do with slides, however when I pull the Crocs strap back, both feet are snug and grip the ground firmly much more than I anticipated. Will test on wet floors, beach, hot tar, and concrete. Any other tests anyone wants done let me know and maybe I'll experiment with them. I'll do an update review in a month or sooner if they wind up being my summer go to shoe. Giving 5 starts because so far everything promised was given from quick delivery to a proper fit. Will change if things don't work out, but for now Crocs is living up to the hype.

Better Than Expected
",Donald Gillette,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I was hesitant to buy these for a couple of reasons.  First, they're...you know--rubber? Plastic? Something like that...  Second, they're...you know--not masculine? Kind of sissified? Finally, the picture makes them look flimsy. So okay. Yes--they are some kind of man-made rubber/plastic/neoprene/something, but that makes them waterproof meaning you can leave them out on the deck after you've been working in the yard and you don't have to worry about them getting soggy and ruined. No--they're not the most masculine shoes I've ever seen, so you have to be pretty confident in your manhood if you wear them out on the town but I got them for yard work which is a fairly macho enterprise. And no, they're not as flimsy as the pictures look. I don't know how long that heel-strap thing will last, but I don't use it half the time anyway and for some reason, your feet don't slip out of the shoes without it, so if it does break--Super Glue and duct tape. THEN they'll look masculine!

  I used to have heel pain --  plantar fascia.  I stretched a couple times a day and that mostly kept the pain at bay.  Then a friend suggested crocs.  Pain gone.

Almost all of the styles that I tried were narrower.  My 'real shoe' size is 11 EEE.  Crocs Mens 12 work in this style.  If they feel a little tight at first, keep wearing them.  They stretch and, like fine leather shoes, mold to the feet.

I have a size 15 foot. I was just amazed that I could get them in a size-15 for $30. I bought my daughter a pair and they were $10 more for the same basic style. .. Go figure? Glad I got them. They will be a great Summer/house shoes for me. Flip flops are not made for guys with a size 15 foot. These crocs have got to be the next best thing to flip flops..... maybe better.

So comfy!!!
",Joy and David,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are the most comfortable ugly shoes I've ever had! I have high arches and find it so hard to find a comfortable shoe with enough support. These I can wear all day long and I don't feel like I need to put more comfortable shoes on. I love them! Ment to get the black but accidentally ordered navy blue. That's ok, should go good with my hean shorts.

Ugly, but comfy
",Lindsey ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  For the longest time, ever since they came out really, I thought Crocs were the ugliest shoes. I couldn't see why anybody wore them. However, my boyfriend owns a pair, and I had to wear them a few times (granted his feet are quite bigger than mine). They. Are. Comfortable. As. Heck. It took a while, but I finally decided that I needed to buy a pair of my own. My feet hurt all the time, especially my heels because that's where I put all of my weight when standing. Let me tell you: I can walk around for hours wearing these shoes, and I don't feel any discomfort. Even after a 9-hour shift of standing and walking around at work, I can put these on, and my feet already feel better. Do yourself a favor and buy yourself a pair. I wear 8 1/2, so I dropped down a half size as recommended, and they fit perfectly.

",Beloved,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I had a pair of these that I had worn almost every day for 6+ years that somehow got lost during a hospital stay.  I was so sad ... and immobilized, as these shoes are what I wear around my house every day while I chase my kiddos and do chores!  If I don't wear them my feet hurt so badly.  After a week or so of going barefoot and not wearing them I ended up with a full limp and a sore knee (from walking funny because of my foot pain).  My husband couldn't stand it anymore and told me to order another pair PRONTO!  I did, and within a day my feet felt great again!  I have incredibly high arches, and these are one of the few types of shoes I can wear for extended periods of time without any pain.  I loooove my crocs!!

4x4 Capable - Comfortable Design
",Mike O. ,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Very comfortable footwear that is perfect to have by the back door of you go in and out of the house frequently. They feel good on the bottom of your feet because of the bumpy pattern of the shoe that contacts your sole. They stay on great, and if you need more security you can flip over the strap and put them in four wheel drive mode. I typically wear a 13, or sometimes a 12 1/2 of a shoe manufacturer even makes it, but in these I wear a 12. If your feet sweat, you might find they sweat more in these. However, my feet seem to be getting use to them and seem to be sweating less the more that I wear them. They are a great product, designed well, and seem robust enough to last for years. I would definitely recommend.

  Brought these to slip on if I need to run errands quick and for the summer to wear when I go on a boat or to the beach. These are perfect for all of those things. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. Even though I would have liked if these came in half sizes due to the fact that when you put the strap on in the back, your foot is pushed literally to the top of the shoe which to me isn‚Äôt uncomfortable, but I know for some individuals it may be. I also like a little bit of a looser fit. But other than that, I couldn‚Äôt be happier with this buy!

  Finally gave in, and I love them -- I have resisted crocs for many years, because they look, to be brutal, stupid.  But we spend the winter on the beach, and I got tired of ruining at least two pairs of white sandals a year by getting them wet when I was totally sure I wouldn't.  So: crocs.  The reviews left me frightened of mis-sizing, so I shot an arrow in the air and ordered an eight, which fits perfectly.  They are comfortable on the beach, comfortable around the house, and comfortable when we go out on errands.  Mine are white, and they have stayed dazzlingly clean looking.  On the downside, they do accumulate debris, and the do look -- stupid.  But noone is asking me to wear them on Madison Avenue, and for a beach community, they are just great.

  I ordered this pair of crocs for my 80 year older father as a safer and more supportive option to slippers for those days that his feet are swollen.My father's legs and feet swell, so he tends to wear open back slippers because of the ease of putting them on when his feet swell, however, there is no support and they are a fall risk since they can easily fall off his feet.  The crocs on the other hand are a roomy, solid option for when his feet swell and the air holes help to keep his feet cool, unlike shoes. The back strap keeps them on his feet, thus keeping him safer.

  These are of course super comfortable but beware the strap (see picture) makes them about a size smaller than my normal croc size. For some reason with the white crocs the strap comes in almost a whole inch from the back of the shoe. So if you rock socks and crocs and/or like the strap down to lock in the shoe, your toe will rub in the front if you get your normal size. Which I found uncomfortable. Thankfully Amazon has great returns and I was able to get the best fitting size. Normal size men‚Äôs 11 I went up to men‚Äôs 12 and fit great.

  I use the Crocs as camp shoes on my hiking trips. They provide protection for my toes when walking around camp and for water crossings.  I wear a Woman's 8.5 shoe but this size (Women's 8 M/Men's 6M) works for me. They are a bit large around the toe box but is doable. I do like the movable strap which a nice option.  These are light weight compared to the other shoes I have tried.  They weigh around 10 ounces.

  As a swimmer, my daughter is obsessed with these shoes. Oddly, or not, the white Croc is one of the most elusive colors to come by, and Amazon delivered. I don‚Äôt think she‚Äôs taken them off. Side note: And the magic eraser (from a major brand) cleans these up beautifully.

Happy to find the basic Crocs still available at a reasonable price. Worn them for years.
",Berry,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Worn these for years as house shoes. Happy they still make and sell these. I developed neuropathy in my legs and it effects my feet too.I use cotton socks with these and the design allows air and room but still gives to support and cushion needed (even if a lil large) for people also susceptible to painful mio-facitis like myself. Don't want that again! I am happy they still sell the basic ones that are less expensive than some of the others. Even though I do own several of the more expensive stylish Crocs sandals and shoes. Mostly for comfort.

They're exactly as expected except for the weird insole ""mini-spikes.""
",QD Jenkins,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Got them for my 12-year-old along with the little charms the kids stick in the holes. She immediately put them on and skip away, only to shriek and stop in her tracks due to the unexpected little mini-spikes that are all over the insoles. I guess you get used to them, but I'm not sure of their purpose, especially for the soft skin of kids. But she wore them - with socks this first time, which was nuts. But I don't ask questions.

Size 8 US Men - Good fit on a slightly wide foot
",JK in CA,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have a slightly wide foot, size 8 men's, and they fit comfortably in the size 8 US Men's Classic Clog (the standard size, not wider model). It's roomy, but not to the point where my foot flops around feels insecure, and there's enough room to wear the clogs with socks on. I like that they're easy to slip on and off and have good traction on wet surfaces. So now I just have to see how they'll do over time. They're replacing a pair of sandals that I bought in Hawaii thirty years ago and are still wearable, but I like the fact that the Crocs have a little more toe protection.

When it's early in the morning or middle of the night and my canine wants to venture out, sometimes it's not easy to affix my shoes to my hooves when I'm half asleep. I can just slip these suckers on without even trying. They're ugly but in a charming way. They are moderately comfortable, though they do make my feet sweat. Not really a problem though since I plan on wearing them even when it's cold outside.

Crocs for a win
",Cedrie,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I spend 40 hours a week on my feet on concrete floors. And I walk a lot. I have a very difficult time finding shoes that I don't ache to take off before a couple hours have past. I have wide feet, tall feet, and have a heel lift I wear in my left shoe (which creates its own shoe criteria). I need slip resistant ventilated shoes. These classic crocs fit the bill. I will always be wearing these with socks. They are wide enough for my feet, tall enough for my instep (even with the heel lift) and are quite comfortable to wear all shift. These are not fashion shoes and I don't expect them to be that, but for all the rest of the times, these will be the shoes I wear. My only caution would be that these shoes have little cushion. The rubber does have some give but it is not the same as a well padded shoe. For me this is acceptable because they don't hurt my feet to wear. Other's may find that to be a turn off.

  Let's face it. Crocs are ugly. Having said that, I bought these and wear them constantly - they are like walking barefoot with rubber bumpers. I had to re-learn my natural gait after hip replacement last year and Crocs were my go-to shoe during that time. I've recommended Crocs to friends having knee surgery for the same reason. These classic style black Crocs are the same size as purple classics I've had for years but these fit the way shoes should - I didn't realize how loose and big the older pair were. I believe they were manufactured in different countries which seems to make a difference in sizing. Go Crocs!

Can't go wrong with Crocs!
",Kathi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have been wearing this style of Crocs for many years.  Can't go wrong with them.  I have feet that are difficult to fit and need to wear something around the house that has a bit of arch support.  Crocs are the only footwear that fits the bill.  The toe box is ample, the width is just right, the length fits perfectly.  In ""normal"" shoes, I wear a size 10 XXW and these are perfect!

Love These Crocs
",Dede Stafford,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These Crocs (as always) are incredibly comfy, durable, breathable, lightweight, and easy to clean.  Attractive??  Not so much. (But I will say that I love this particular color!!) Perfect for wearing around the house/doing outside work...especially as the weather warms up. Crocs are a staple in my closet.

  My daughter suddenly has a Croc obsession.  She has about 7 pairs, all different colors.  She loves their fit and how comfortable they are.  She has been wearing them to school (high school) and seems to be starting a trend.  She also wears them to the softball field and in between games. (Camo is her field color)  She referred her friends to Amazon as the shipping is free AND they have a great variety AND they are cheaper than at the outlets.  I think I will even be getting a pair or 2 for Christmas...  :)  BUT WE CANNOT FIND PURPLE FOR A LOWER PRICE!  That is her high school color...  They aren't as cheap as the other colors for some reason.  :(But we still love Crocs!!

Convienent shoes
",Allison,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  The ideal user for this product is any person boy or girl who is looking for a comfortable, durable, and water resistant shoe. These shoes are perfect slide on shoes for any quick, pick up situation. Whether that be running errands, taking the dog out, or anything else. These shoes are made for all ages, come in a variety of colors and are made for both sexes.These shoes are very durable and water resistant. I bought a pair of white ones in august of 2017, and they still look brand new (and I wear them way too often.) They clean up very easily and are perfect if the ground outside is wet or muddy. They have holes along the side and on the top which allows your feet to breathe. An amazing quality about these shoes is that they are wide enough so you have enough space in the shoe to wear a sock!These shoes have many positive characteristics about them. I would say the most positive aspect of them is that they are very convenient, and can be worn in any situation. But other positive aspects of these shoes are that they are comfortable, breathable, easy to clean, water resistant, come in all colors, and the list is endless!Most people are hesitant in purchasing these shoes because of the way they look, but since 2016 crocs have become popular again. If a shoe like these are this comfy no one should care about what they look like! I have had a very positive experience with my crocs and I would recommend any to purchase these, because they are worth the money. I am all about convenience and these shoes are my go to whenever I‚Äôm about to run out and need to slide something on quick.These shoes are made for everyone and not only are they convenient for an adult to wear, they are perfect shoes for children to wear as well. They can get them dirty and run around outside and the can be cleaned off fast, while not being ruined. They also sell gibbets for these shoes, making them personable and a fun attraction for children.Overall I would give these shoes overall a very positive review because I have gotten a lot of use out of mine. They are worth every penny and a great investment. They last a long time and are great shoes to own.

The best house shoes ever made
",Toospendie,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  This is my third pair of Crocs clogs. I personally think they're ugly and I can't figure out how they ever became fashionable but so it goes. The thing is, I have fallen arches (pes planus) and I my feet kill (I used the word ""kill"" to describe pain) me sometimes! These are far and away the most comfortable things I can put on my feet. They're light as air and they kind of form-fit to my arches. It's like getting a mini-massage just by walking around. I wear them whenever I'm lounging around the house or doing chores but I don't wear them outside at all. Something else to note: They don't stink. At least not for a long time. I think that's pretty remarkable. When they do start to smell, I couldn't really figure out an effective way to clean them so I just threw them away and bought new ones (they also lose their form a little after a year or so). I figure I can afford a pair every year or so so that I can have happier feet.

  I have resisted these shoes for years! Finally tired of ruining my regular shoes by wearing them in the garden or accidentally stepping in something I should have picked up earlier, I have finally found a shoe that I can wear and wash--and is TRULY COMFORTABLE AND LIGHT. You don't really think about how light shoes are until you put Crocs on. In fact, I liked them so much I bought a second pair to wear out and about. I never thought it would happen but I am truly a Crocs lover now!To be fair, I don't love the way they look, and my feet sometimes get cold so I bought socks. (Yes, I went there!) But I have gotten to a point in my life that function beats form and I am the happier for it.

  Crocs are ugly. We all know it. Nobody buys crocs to be a fashion icon (I hope). This aside, they're a good utilitarian shoe. My husband has to wear close-toed shoes to his work, and tennis shoes were killing his feet (they're big and not made to fit inside confining shoes ha).He has to wear socks with them (really highlighting his stellar sense of fashion) because apparently the holes on top pull the hair out of the top of his feet. Go figure. However other than that, he says they're comfortable and provide good support.I was also pleased that these shoes come in boat size, as not all brands carry for large-footed people.

  I usually wear a size 10D, and ordered these in size 10D.  If I wore these with socks, they'd be a perfect fit.  In bare feet, they're just a little loose (surprise surprise).  I wish they'd been available in my size in another color.  My only option was Khaki, which looks like rice-fed doggy poop.  But I don't wear 'em to look at them.  I wear them because they feel great.  And for the price (under $20, delivered by amazon Prime, go amazon!) I can't complain.  They're great clomp around clogs, keep your feet warm wet or dry, kick out irritants through the many open holes, and are very comfortable on my feet.  I have yet to use the heel strap or take them for a significant walk, but that's not why I bought them.  I wanted super easy on and off, comfortable enough to run errands in, and secure enough on my feet that I didn't have to think about where I put my feet when walking in them.  They fit the bill quite nicely, thank you very much.

Don't get me wrong, Flip-Flops have a huge place in my heart but I just took my crocks on a 7700 mile motorcycle camping trip and I was so happy I had them. They were a great component to what I needed to be comfortable. Just give them a try but just don't start wearing them to work. Just not acceptable..

",Bmcgnh,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  This shoes are far from fashionable and I *never* wear mine outside the house but they are great comfortable footwear. They were recommended to me by my orthopedic surgeon when I was struggling with plantar fasciitis that was aggravated by the hardwood floors in our apartment. He recommended a pair of Crocs to wear as house slippers since they have great arch support.There fit somewhat sloppy though--that's just the way they are. Don't get them too tight. When in doubt I'd suggest you order the larger size.Easy to slip into and out of and if I spill something on the floor or on the shoes I just wash them off in the sink.

  I got this particular pair for my son, and he likes to wear it. He is size 6.5 or 7, and he wears the shoes with the strap up, so they fit him very well. He outgrown several pairs of crocs over the years, and always like them.However, if you wanted to wear the strap behind your heel as pictured, buy a size up - the strap is shorter then needed, I wear Woman's size 9 so should fit in this shoes well, but with the strap down, my toes painfully push into the front of the shoe, and I cannot wear them. The problem is consistent - I have several years old pair of the same crocs in another color, and it is the same - fine with the strap up, but I cannot wear it with strap down.The shoes are very lightweight.

Wide toe box, secure heel strap, vented, lightweight. I bought my normal size. Even though I have skinny feet these fit fine.

Order 1-2 sizes smaller depending on whether you wear socks or not
",Bansidhe,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These shoes are huge for their size.  We ordered 10s at first and they were gigantic and had to be returned.  Downsized to 9s and they are still at least 1 size too long, and kinda loose height and width wise.  If you plan to wear without socks the. Order 2 sizes smaller unless you have a really wide, thick foot.  Upsides are that they are lightweight and comfortable if you order the right size

Fits fine w/o Sports mode, W/ Sports mode its a little tight
",Here2Help‚ÄºÔ∏è,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  This is my first pair of Crocs and I wear a size w8.5. I got the size m6/w8. When I'm not in sports mode (w/o the strap in the back of my foot), they fit fine and there's some wiggle room, just right! However, when I'm in sports mode (w/ the straps in the back), they fit kind of tight and my big toe rubs against the front.I was debating on whether or not on getting a size m7/w9 too. But I found that when trying it on, it was too big, so I stuck w/ the size m6/w8.

These may be fake - but  pretty comfortable anyway

  It says made in Vietnam but I thought Crocs were made in the US.  They are much shinier and slicker than my other ones (that were getting worn out on the bottom).  but they fit well and are comfortable, so I kept them.  They are very slick with bare feet, but I usually wear socks anyway.  Also, they did not hand deliver it.  Why do they say that?  Delivery people should not lie.

Best comfortable fitting shoe
",Dave Musil,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I love these and wear them a lot. They have the typical Croc roomy fit which feels almost like you're barefoot.  You think that they would come off your foot when you walk but they don't.  They feel sort of gel-like on your feet with their cushiony rubber. I really like the option of using the heel strap or flipping it up so you can slip in and out of them easily, like slippers.  You get used to their quirky appearance, if not, get one of the more traditional looking models. I have three different styles which I wear exclusively as casual shoes.

We like wearing them after a shower at the gym (where flip flops for the shower) to air out or feet. Sometimes we where them at home however, they attract dog hair like nobody's business. There are people who have videos and instructions on how to remove pet hair from your carpet with these things. So on carpet and wood floor they are great for them but that is not my purpose.They feel great so I will keep wearing them.

They're so cheap. And so squishy comfortable.The fit is spot on for me. I wear size nine in most shoes and the Croc 9 is perfect in length.

Great Fit & Design! Very Satisfied!
",cjl,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I am so happy to find a cute pair of Crocs that will go with my jeans and any top I might wear with them. What I am most excited about, is these crocs fit my feet very well. In the last year or two I've had problems with the new sizing for Crocs (purchased directly) and have had to return or giveaway or not wear four pairs. So I took a chance on ordering  this pair  and I was thrilled that they fit and they look really cute. I normally wear a size woman's nine which is what I ordered.  I am so pleased that I am going to order another pair just like them so I expect to be set for a number of years! One additional note, I have diabetic nerve damage and Crocs are the most comfortable shoes for my feet, in addition they keep my feet protected and provide additional stability for walking.  I couldn't be more pleased to have found this new design and one that fits so perfectly.

Not quite the same as older crocs
",Terez,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These just aren't quite the same as the Crocs I've been wearing for years. The material is a bit ""harder"" and does not have the softness that I'm used to. And the size is slightly smaller. With this pair, I can wear them with the strap moved forward but if I put the strap around my foot, then my toe touches the front of the shoe. In all my other crocs, I've had a comfortably loose fit even when using the strap.My street shoes size is a women's 10. In crocs I wear a Men's 9/Women's 11. I've always worn this size in Crocs, and that's the size these are (I double-checked the sole to make sure).I kept these and am wearing them without the strap but just wanted to let others know that they seem to be making them smaller than they used to.

Best thing since sliced bread!
",J. Ramsey,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I love my crocs! I wear them everywhere on dry days and even in the shower. I bought one pair in yellow and they were so comfortable I bought another in brown to wear out. The brown ones were different sizing than the yellow ones since the yellow beach ones were size 8-9 and the brown ones size Women's 8M. Both fit fine but the brown ones fit best with thin socks if I wear socks.I have diabetes and liver cirrhosis, both of which cause problems with legs and feet, so I need shoes that are very comfortable and not too tight. Crocs really are perfect. I thought the little bumps in the bottom inside would bother me in bare feet but they don't. They are roomy enough that if my feet swell a bit they still fit. They sort of stick to the soles of my feet (even with socks) so there's no rubbing against my sensitive skin.They are also great in the shower. I don't have to worry about slipping, especially when I use hair conditioner or body wash that is slippery, and I can wash my crocs at the same time I wash me. Fantastic!

",Danny F.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I originally bought these so that I didn't have to put on socks and shoes just to check the mail (rocky driveway). I had no idea that I would love them as much as I do.Pros:- incredibly comfortable, I could wear them all day- my feet are wide, and they still fit perfectly- there is almost nothing you can do to mess them up, just wash the rubberCons:- when using the heel strap, it is very difficult for me to remove the shoes. I know that this is a feature, as that is the literal purpose of the strap, but sometimes it feels like a bug.These are the most versatile slip-on shoes I've ever owned.

For Ease & Comfort
",Paperden,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  It's about the ease of donning & doffing and general comfort. It's not about any aesthetic appeal, which it is perhaps not particularly high on. I found my first pair (of the original Crocs--new in box) while dumpster diving several years ago. I brought them home to show my wife just how absurd a pair of shoes can look. For a lark, I tried them on and--what do you know? Those goofy-looking shoes were extremely comfortable! I have worn them near daily ever since. Interestingly, after they started getting popular and appearing on lots of other people's feet, they stopped looking quite so goofy.As much as I like them, they are problematic for some occasions. Little rocks and dirt sometimes get in through the holes; when the soles get worn smooth from use they are extremely slippery on wet sidewalks; goathead stickers and glass can easily pierce through the soft sole and into your previously happy foot; Bare feet can sweat in the summer and slide around a bit; I wear them so much that I get tan spots through the holes, leaving my feet polka-dotted when I remove my shoes.Overall though, for the reasons of ease and comfort, I love 'em.

Bought as a gift for a friend
",patricia,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  My friend has very large, wide feet for a women. She had purchased a pair of knockoffs at a discount store, same size, and had to return them because her toes bumped/rubbed the front of the shoe. This was not noticed at the store, but she gave them a good workout on carpeting (to protect the shoes in case she did have to return them) at home and found them to be uncomfortable. She gave the Crocs the same workout and was delighted by the fit and comfort. And as a bonus her favorite color is blue. And the knockoffs only came in black. So I gave a great gift, my friend has happy feet, and we had a great birthday party.  It has been several months since her bithday, she wears them every day after work. Still very happy with the Crocs.

  These are the best for wearing around the house and outside.  They are much better than regular house slippers. They have great cushioning for the heel and ball of the foot, as long as you aren't walking on rocks. They arch support is good.

If you wear them without the heel band than the fit is no issue.Updated a few minutes later: I actually tried on my 6 year old 9 size pair, and they fit perfectly, band or no band. Hmmm.

This style isn‚Äôt my favorite (the Mary Jane style is my favorite) but they serve the purpose. I am on my feet all day. In this style I should have ordered an 8 to have room for thick socks.

  If you don't care about what people think about your fashion sense these are the most comfortable shoes to buy ever. plus when they get dirty you can wear them in the shower or wash them in the sink. as you wear them the rubber will wear down and mold to the shape of your foot which only makes them even more comfortable. a pair will provide about 2-3 years of frequent use before the rubber becomes too thin and you step on a thorn that gets stuck in your foot for about a week.

  If you are buying Crocs always buy a size smaller. For example if your size is UK8 then choose the corresponding size for UK7.

Rest the footwear fits and feels good on feet with its lightweight structure.

As expected, and even surprised
",M. K. Johnson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I am not normally a Crocs fan because there is zero arch support, but I needed a pair to accomodate the compression wraps on my feet, which I had to wear for over a month. I ordered up a couple of sizes, thanks to the handy measurement guide provided. They have worked out fabulously, and the price was just right where I was comfortable, considering I won't be wearing them for long. And surprisingly, I've not had any back issues or a flare in my plantar fasciitis, so mabye the arch support is sufficient enough after all. I'm actually considering ordering a pair of the wooly style for the winter!

Fit my wide feet and were very comfortable.
",Roxane,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I had always thought Crocs were rather unattractive shoes and didn't understand how and why people would wear them. Then I retired, bought a power washer, and badly needed some outdoor shoes that could handle the water and still give me the traction to push the mower. (I did NOT want to get my nice athletic shoes all wet and green from the grass.) A shoe store associate directed me to the Croc. I knew the Croc was a wider shoe and only came in whole sizes. So I ordered an 8 even though I wear an 8.5. This shoe fit my wide feet perfectly and was very comfortable. I love, love, love that I don't have to worry about getting dirt, water, soap, grass stains, etc. on these shoes because I can just wash them off with the hose. In the meantime, my athletic shoes stay in pristine condition. THEN, I started wearing the Crocs around the house while cleaning and running up and down the stairs doing laundry. I am even considering wearing them when I run to the grocery store or gym!! Another bonus is that these shoes come in a variety of attractive colors,

Every weekend in and out of the lake water, worn while mowing the lawn, going for a walk, whatever - and they just don't stink.  These are worth every penny!

Worth the price

  This is worth the price - this is my second pair of Crocs, and I've had two other pairs of the ""off"" brands to compair to.  My first pair of Crocs lasted 2 years of wearing them EVERYWHERE!!  The Brand X last 6 months for one pair and 9 months for another.  These are well worth the price.  Now, the comfort.  My first pair took me a bit to get used to the 'nubs' on the bottom...I had to wear socks for the first couple of months but with socks or without socks, they were the most comfortable - I took a trip with a Youth Group Geo-caching in San Francisco and if you've ever been geo-caching, you know that you walk and walk and walk - I must have logged over 6 miles in the 3 hours, up hills and down and my feet felt wonderful.

  If you have classic crocs that you bought 5 years ago you'll find these running smaller than those did. That is, big for shoes, small for crocs. They are a little shorter, a little narrower and especially not as high in the toe box (i.e. lower profile). I wear 8 1/2 wide in standard women's shoes, and 8W, 6M in crocs was always perfect for me before. Now I think I would order a size up next time, even on what Croc bills as a ""roomy"" fit.

I bought a pair at my wife's urging because I have some foot problems...achy feet, plantar fasciitis, etc. The Crocs are incredibly comfortable to wear and bring immediate comfort and relief when I wear them. I have them next to my bed and slip them on first thing in the morning. I normally wear a size 13...when I get another pair I will be getting them in a size 12. The 13's are a little long and wide...not a problem, but I think I'll go one size smaller next time (and there WILL be a next time!)

  The color (khaki) is not great, but that was what was available when I ordered. These are for in the house, so who cares? These are replacements for some Crocs I have had over five years. Hard to tell when they wear out, but these new ones support my feet much better. On the arch support question - better than bedroom slippers, less than good athletic shoes. NOTE: Occasionally I will see an adult were Crocs in public - please don't! These are house shoes only!

  I was used to purchasing Crocs in the ""from-to"" size range ( 9-10, etc.) so the size setup on these was a bit strange for me. The shoes are fine and I should be able to wear them for quite some time with no problem, but they are a wee bit narrower than my other crocs and since my feet tend to swell a bit in hot weather the narrower width might be a problem.

Five stars for comfort but not quality
",rachel,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Just wanted to write a review on this particular pair of crocs. I gave it five stars because they are so comfortable, but I ordered a pair for my son at the end of August, he has wore them to school many days and the strap already broke and we are only into December right now. By the school rules, he is not allowed to wear them at school unless they have a strap on them. Very disappointed as our return window has passed. Normally I feel like crocs last forever but not this pair.

  ¬†LOVE, LOVE, LOVE these crocs! I ordered my usual size and they came slightly bigger than I was expecting them to, so I threw them in the dryer with a wet towel for about 4min. and they came out perfect! I've never had crocs before and it's my understanding that they're supposed to be larger shoes, but I prefer having a tighter fit. Overall, super comfy, easy to pair with outfits and perfect for a trip to the grocery store, walking the dogs, or going shopping with friends!

",Jennifer L Eliassen,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have to admit I really find the classic Croc unattractive, but incredibly practical under the right circumstances.  I dislike it for an everyday, all day shoe, but great for the beach or gardening.  Of course, my kids love them.  I have slipped on my son's from time to time (we wear the same size) and they are comfortable to walk in, but slippery if the inside gets wet.  The back strap doesn't really hold the heel the way I think a back strap should.Turns out my son wanted a bright color and was not excited about the khaki color, but he wears a lot of khaki shorts and I think it looks great.  He's 9, so for him bright and bold would be better!  The price I got on Amazon was better than at my local Croc store.

  I can never say crocs are ""beautiful shoes"", but they're very comfortable and excellent to wear around the house. I buy a pair and wear them for many years until the bottoms are completely worn out. I've never had a complaint about my crocs. I do suffer from plantar fasciitis so I put inserts in them for additional arch support. It would be awesome to see a pair developed that would make the additional insole support unnecessary.

  These have a  cushiony sole and are well made. I got them to wear while I work in the yard and they are perfect for this because I can just rinse them off with the hose when I'm done. I ordered the Women's size 9. I usually wear an 8.5 but I listened to the reviews that said they ran small and boy am I glad I did! My toes just touch the end of the shoe. I would say they are about a 1/2 size too small. If I had to wear them for long periods while standing, they would be uncomfortable pretty quickly. So keep that in mind, if you're going to wear them for 8 hours at work. Overall I'm very happy with them.

However, fast forward to when we got our first puppy who has to make countless potty runs at all hours of the night, and these are the most appreciated shoes! They slip on and off without having to lift a finger, and they are incredibly light weight. They are the perfect shoe for roaming around the yard, where no one can see your silly ""garden shoes""!

I've been unable to walk without assistance for a long time, and it occurred to me that I needed to replace them, but the pair I had was purple, and it matched a lot of things in my world, clothes, my car! So I just knew that I had to replace them. I couldn't even read the size on the bottom they were so worn.  I couldn't find them in the size I needed due to swelling in my feet so I had to order a larger size.  Luckily they were available in my second favorite color.  I'm walking so much better!

Lasting (small) Comfort.
",Smulan,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Pros:Color is true to the picture; a very pretty khaki.Fit is very comfortable for those of us with wider feet.Cushioning to keep your feet from tiring.Last for months even with heavy use (such as walking dogs on asphalt for 1-2 hours per day).Con:The sizing is different every time I order these, even though they are all made in Mexico (same factory?). I normally wear a 6.5 US (wider) shoe and usually get a size 6 in Crocs, but had to get a 7 this time. In comparing the 6 I already had to the 7 I just ordered the 6 is a tad larger!

  I was having problems with left ankle pain - to the point that the burning would keep me awake at night. All those years of commuting by bus and train took its toll. My podiatrist recommended I get some Crocs to wear around the house. I am now pain free. I had the tendency to go barefoot when I got home, liking the freedom of ""free feet"". With Crocs, my freedom is not inhibited and I don't know what I would do without them. Immediately on taking off my street shoes and stockings, I slip into my Crocs and don't mind them at all. Thank you, Dr. Daley and the Crocs people. I am now OTC pain killer free.

",Online Purchaser,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Good product. I deploy to bases with ""public use"" showers that everyone uses and this keeps your feet off the ground and clear of the mildew and other unmentionables on the shower floor. They turn white after a while a crack with constant hydration and dehydration of actually taking them into the shower but after 4-6 months of use, I would probably throw them away in that environment anyway no matter how they looked. Very comfortable to wear and just the thing for deployments. Sandals flop around too much.

I am usually a 9.5 and I did as suggested by going down half a size but they are actually a bit big; however, with the sport strap, they fit perfectly!

  I'm very pleased with these Crocs. Never had Crocs before, and I was hesitant about looking goofy, but these are the best knock-arounds I've had in years. I struggle finding slides that will stay on my feet, but these are great‚Äîthey have the strap thingy in the back that also rotates to the front if you don't need it. Even without the strap, these stay on my feet better than any other slides I've owned. And the support is terrific‚Äîthe first time I wore them I took a 2.5 mile walk and they were extremely comfortable. They run a little large. I usually wear a men's 10.5, but they don't have half sizes, so I got 10s. They fit great, and if anything might be a bit large. Inexpensive, durable, easy to clean, great for doing yard work, shopping, or whatever.

They are a bit roomy, but I expected as much. The bergundy color is as pictured. I recommend them and will be buying another pair when these wear out.

Excellent
",Bijou B,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I was a little bit unsure about purchasing these because of some of the negative reviews.  I normally wear a women's 9 - 9.5 & although instructions for sizing said to go a size down on half sizes, I decided to go up.  (Personal preference - I just prefer a roomier fit.)  Very comfortable and not too roomie.  So glad I decided to go up on sizing instead of down.I have owned a lot of the knock-off brands in the past and I can honestly say that comfort-wise, they do not hold a candle to real Crocs.  Spend a little bit more for the real thing.  So worth it!!!

Great comfort in these Crocs
",Amazon Customer,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Great comfort in these Crocs!  I don't wear them a lot because I have custom orthotics but when I do (evening for about 15 minutes) I'm in heaven.  I ordered a size 8 and have a wide foot. These shoes let my foot spread out comfortably even more than my shoes with orthotics.  Since I have foot issues, I checked these out on lots of shoe review pages and Web MD as well.  They are highly rated for comfort and fit although I think I would need more support for a 2 mile walk.

Love kicking around the house and garden in these
",KayPW,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I've been looking for something easy to wear around the house and patio garden for quite some time and have always ended up settling for flip-flops which provide zero support. I've wondered about Crocs but have never tried them before. A friend mentioned she used them to garden in and I decided to order a pair. I'm very satisfied. They're comfortable, easy to slog on and off, and because of all the holes, my feet remain cool. The 9M is on the roomy side, but my feet are more wide than narrow. Still, they stay on my feet without use of the back strap. Good purchase!

",Andrea,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I know some people think they have arch support, but I don't feel any.  Then again, I need a really high arch in my shoes.  So take that for what it's worth.  I usually wear Birks, but I like to wear crocs around the house so I don't have to switch shoes if I'm gardening or washing dogs outside.  And when I bruised the bottom of my feet I needed to wear softer shoes for several weeks and crocs fit the bill.

They weren't, they were too small.  Thankfully it was no problem to return them and order one size bigger.  I picked the tan/khaki color and haven't regretted it for a second.

  I bought these brown Crocs to replace a pair of black ones that were becoming slick on the bottom after 10 years of wear. I use these for rain shoes, gardening and beach shoes.

They do not feel like clouds, but they will serve their waterproof purpose. Sized exactly the same as the old ones. The brown color kind of faded-looking.

",Susie the Swimmer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Actually, I bought these for my husband who needed a pair for a vacation where he'll be at the sea.  We could not find a pair of men's that fit him because they were all too big.  When I looked on Amazon, I was pleased to find that the sizes are for either men or women, so I took a chance and bought him what's considered to be a woman's size.  When they arrived, he immediately tried them on and found that they fit perfectly and felt good.  Amazon, thank you.

  When it comes to comfortable footwear, it doesn't get better than these.  Ugly, most assuredly.  But get 'em in a dark color and most people will never notice.  But your feet and legs will.FYI:  It's cheaper to purchase these from Amazon than it is from the actual Crocs site.  AND Crocs makes great, comfortable ATTRACTIVE sandals.

Knockaround Comfort
",J.Lee,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I was reluctant to try out these ugly clogs, but finally decided to see what the fuss was all about and took them on a trek in the Panama rain forest and wore them as a camp shoe for a week. Even though the Caymen is supposed to be a closer fit than the Beach, they still feel very loose, as if they're going to fall off, at first. But after getting used to them and forgetting I had them on, I realize that this contributes to the comfort. Unlike my usual sandals, these dry by simply wiping them off which is a huge benefit in wet environments. I still think they're fugly but they're extremely comfortable for wear around the house or camp, and light enough to always take with you on your travels.

You made me love you. I didn't want to do it. I REALLY didn't want to do it!
",madamwillyoutalk,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Okay, so, let me get this review started off by saying I hate the way the original crocs look. I know, I know, so do a lot of people, but I really hate the way they look. I have always had large feet for a woman (10/10.5), so I really don‚Äôt like shoes that emphasize the fact that I am walking around with feet that could double as water skis at a moment‚Äôs notice.  As many of you have observed, these shoes are not very good at minimizing the appearance of the size of feet they are on.Okay, so now that I have my fussing out of the way, I love my crocs. To the point where if my house was on fire and I could save one pair of shoes, I would save my crocs.I was first introduced to crocs when I was 20 after I developed an almost crippling case of plantar fasciitis due to working a retail job where I wore heels on hard tiled floor for 10+ hours, 5-6 days a week. I could barely walk without being in excruciating pain. Not fun. I went to see a podiatrist who didn‚Äôt do any of the useful things most would have done like offering the night splints or anything like that. He said that I could do a series of injections in my feet, which sounded oh-so appealing, or I could do some stretches, stay off my feet as much as possible, and try wearing crocs whenever I could. I took option b.  I started wearing my crocs from the moment that I got up, until I had to go to work, where I now had a doctor‚Äôs note saying that I had to have comfortable, flat shoes.  I didn‚Äôt wear the crocs to work, that would have been pushing it, but I did wear the most comfortable shoes I could without making my department manager‚Äôs eye twitch when she looked at them. Then, as soon as I got home, I would take them off, and put my crocs back on. The pain lessened almost immediately, and while it was a combination of keeping off my feet, the stretches, and the crocs, the shoes were definitely the most important factor. They helped so much that I wore them outside of the house while running errands. Within a month, the pain had gone from an all-day, all-consuming factor, to something bothered me for only one hour after waking. After two months, I didn‚Äôt even need to wear them anymore, so I stopped.Fast-forward five and a half years and I am pregnant with my first child and the crocs came out yet again. They were my best friends during the second and third trimester and I haven‚Äôt put them up since. For some reason, probably partially due to the way I sleep, which allows my muscles in my calves and ankles to tense up really well, I have had a mild problem ever since having my daughter. It isn‚Äôt debilitating like the first time, it only hurts for about 10 minutes when I first get up in the morning and I am stretching my muscles out, but I wear my crocs at all times when I am in the house.  My husband, whom I met after my first experience with crocs teased me about them quite a lot. He is European and thinks that crocs are some bizarre American fashion statement and had an excellent time laughing at them. But he also has a job where he is on his feet all day, and a month ago he started showing symptoms of plantar fasciitis. I gave him my crocs to wear around the house, remember, I have giant feet, and they went up a size due to my pregnancy to boot (11) , and he has wears a 10.5 in men‚Äôs shoes, so while mine were a little tight, they were comfortable enough. He stopped giving me any grief after he spent a few days clomping around the house in my bright purple crocs. After I peeled myself off the floor after a very satisfying guffaw I got him to admit that they were really helping and that he didn‚Äôt want to walk around without them anymore. Victory is mine! So, because I wanted me crocs back, guess what he got for Christmas? A lovely pair of plain, black crocs all his own.Now, I‚Äôm not a doctor or nurse of any kind, but I can tell that these have really helped my husband and I ease the pain from, and in my earlier case eliminate, a painful condition. Are they pretty? No. Have they worked for us? Yes.I have a pair of size Women's 11 crocs right now and they are perfect for walking around the house, but they are a bit loose, I wouldn't want to try to sprint in them. I have wide feet, and they are perfectly roomy, not tight at all.I bought my husband a Men's size 10, he usually wears a 10.5, and they are a little roomy for him as well, but not to the point where it is an issue. So, judging from my experience, these run a little large and wider than average.

Roomy but comfortable
",Michael,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  As other purchasers have noted, the sizing of Croc brand clogs is off. I would guess that these and the pair of Croc Sport clogs are a full size larger than the number sizing would indicated. Because these are clingy to the foot, they don't shift around despite the sizing so we chose not to exchange for a smaller size. Previous non-Croc branded clogs we've owned shrank over time, especially when exposed to a lot of sun so it is possible that Croc brands do the same and account for the generous sizing. Overall, the build quality is quite good and these Crocs are comfortable.

  What can I say, they are Crocs. They are comfortable. They are not the most stylish shoes but the fact that they can be worn everywhere in Orlando makes up for that. They are fine to get wet at the beach or pool, fine to get sand all over, fine to wear in the mud (as long as you don't mind your feet getting muddy too) because you just have to hose them off. I was just happy to finally find a pair in mens size 13 for my husband. He has wanted them for a couple of years now and we could never find his size. I never thought to look online until a few days ago. I'm glad I did.

  The white color is an eye sore and will take on the color of whatever ground you're standing on... That being said I love them. Extremely comfortable and light. Great for a campsite shoe. You can just clip them to your bag which is huge for saving pack space. I personally enjoyed cracking jokes about my white crocs, so a fun shoe for that.

  Crocs are about the only shoes I wear due to my wide foot and particularly high arch. My last pair of crocs were a different style and they were considerably narrower.

I held back one star because the footbed feels thinner than it used to be... walking on a gravel path these feel more like a year old pair than brand new. Still, very happy.

Since they are a clog, however, with the grippy bottom, I have not felt like they would slip off. A bonus that they can get soaking wet with no problem. Wish I had discovered them sooner

I also got some jibbitz to accessorize them and make them unique to myself. The jibbitz also help me to know which ones are mine when distinguishing them from other pairs of crocs. I now have power ranger jibbitz and a really cool alligator jibbit that looks like it is swimming. The purchase of crocs was one of my best decisions and I get a lot of compliments on them.

",Kate,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  The first pair I had were a knock off brand and I got these hoping they would last longer. It's been at least a year and they have. I mainly wear these around the house and the patio. I have bad knees and the cushion in these really help. They are really light weight also. Barely seems like you are wearing anything. I like wearing them while I'm cooking (careful of hot liquid, won't protect from burns) or doing dishes. Also good when you have to be on your feet a long time cleaning and vacuuming. Not good on hot days. Wear with socks if you plan to wear them all day. The grip on the sole is much better than the off brand ones. Still won't wear them on wet ground after slipping badly with my old ones. I do use them as pool shoes though. Buy them a little bigger than you would think because if they are too tight and you wear them without socks you can get blisters easily. My friends kid wears these all the time and he gets blisters because he runs in them. The off brand ones I originally bought i told myself they were for gardening. After slipping a few too many times and being freaked out by bugs crawling in the little holes and I don't use them for that anymore. I have been told many times how ugly these are and i tell the people to try mine on and see how comfy they are. They agree and then say not to wear them in public ha ha.

  Bought these to walk the dogs throughout the day (usually for 20 minutes). Also use them when watering plants/shrubs outside, getting mail, or throwing out trash.  More comfortable than flip-flops as they provide no arch support and you can't really walk fast in them.  Have not worn them longer than one hour.  They fit as expected b/c the description does say they run a little large.  I normally wear a 6.5 so I purchased the Women's 6 US.  You have to get used to the cushioning/padding inside.  They're textured with little plastic nubs that massage your soles as you walk. B/c I don't wear socks, when I take them off and walk on the carpet, there's a strange sensation on the soles of my feet. Not really a complaint, but I can see why it might not be ideal for all-day wear.

  Great shoe, feels nice, but definitely recommend going down one shoe size. I'm normally a 10 but I think a 9 would've been a much better fit. Still, the strap on the back of the shoe prevents it from falling off and I only use these indoors so not going to make a big deal out of it.

Great cheap minimalist Crocs
",Franz Kafka,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  The basic Crocs design, which this model represents, is classic. I use it exclusively as my indoors 'shoe'--when I enter the house, my outside (dirty) shoes come off and the Crocs go on. They're also waterproof, so you can use them in the shower, or at the pool or beach, if you wish. I bought my first pair 5 years ago, and it's indestructible; I only bought this second pair because I needed it to use on vacation. The shoe sizes are generous--I'm a size 12 but wear a size 11 Crocs--so it might pay to try on a few sizes in a store before purchasing it.

  Classic Crocs still get the job done. Lightweight, water tolerant, easy to put on yet stays on your foot. My feet a wide and I appreciate the roominess of Crocs. The strap can be flipped up to make backless sandals or flipped down when you need them to be securely on your feet.

Perfect!
",Lee M.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have been wearing Crocs for years and recently had to replace the ones I have (even though they are pretty much indestructible!) Their comfort and waterproof/mud proof nature makes them perfect for working in the garden and can be easily hosed off to wear again. When purchasing, I would recommend buying them in your exact size, and if a half size: size down. I am a women‚Äôs size 7.5 and the size 7 fit perfectly.

  My favorite summer and lake shoes. Very lightweight and comfortable. Easy on and off and no problem if they get wet. Very quick drying and don't carry dirt in the treads. Easy to clean and rinse off. Great for keeping by the door to go in and out of the garage as well. My wife wishes they got way less use then they do!

One of my favorite pairs of summer shoes
",Lazyfaire,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These Classic Clogs are a staple for summertime, and I was able to purchase these for 1/2 price from Amazon! As usual, they fit true to size yet are roomy enough for my feet to breathe. The cutouts provide plenty of avenues for airflow. They are comfortable enough for me to walk in them all day long. They're not as cute or stylish as some of the other Crocs styles, but I can slip them on easily for quick errands or outside work so they're very practical. I just replaced my first pair, which were almost 10 years old, so they are durable as well.

",MizzouEngr,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These Crocs are very practical. I keep them by the back door to slip on whenever I go outside when the ground is wet and for washing the car. These replace a pair that I wore for over 10 years and they still were not worn out, so I am impressed with the durability of Crocs. Comfort is another issue - for all Crocs I have tried. I find them uncomfortable when worn without socks. With socks, they are OK, but without socks they rub my toes.

Most fashionable? Not really. Comfortable, practical, and durable? Definitely.
",joseph,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Awesome shoes. Adjust the swiveling back securing foot strap and you can wear it all day like any other sandal. I've tried very hard to make them slip off and I couldn't get them to slip off accidentally. Leave the swiveling back securing foot strap towards the front of the shoe and you have a quick and easy slip op show or sandal. The shoe's design is very airy. Obviously you feet will get cold on a cold day, but it's refreshing. I would buy it again, but it's unlikely that'll i'll have to buy another because the Crocs feel solidly built and durable.Note that the shoe is typically larger that average shoe sizes, but frankly it's not a big deal. Mine was a bit larger than my actual foot, but the loose feel is very nice. The shoes don't come off even though they are a tad big.

I think I read somewhere on crocs website if you wear a half size to order a size down.  The size 10 fit well.  My suggestion would be to try them on at a store and then order them on amazon as the price is better.  This way there should be no sizing issues.

  Classic Croc. Quality seems as good as previous crocs. The fit was perfect. If you are unfamiliar with these shoes they are great shoe for gardening, errands, hospital stays, boats, beaches, and any situation you need a cleanable slip on shoe. Every pair our family has had has been very durable.

Go-to shoe
",B. Anderson,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Fits majorly large, last time I wore a size 9 men's shoe I was probably 12 years old. I understand they are meant to be worn with plenty of room for your foot, but I don't really like that setup...too floppy.Though once I found the right size, these things are perfect. My wife wears hers exclusively indoors as 'slippers' because they are so comfortable and wants to get an outdoor pair now.

Durable, comfortable, all-weather
",Michael Brenner,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  This footwear fit my needs perfectly.  I was looking for all-weather, all-terrain footgear that is quick to put on and quick to take off.  Slip-on's were a must.  I use them for walking around outside my house, which means I'm walking in dirt, grass, on cement, on a wooden deck, and so forth.  I also use them for boating on a pontoon boat and for general, quick around-town use.  These clogs fit the bill perfectly.  They are durable, don't get dirty easily, are very easy to clean, and provide the foot with protection without stifling the foot.  I'm very satisfied with this product.  One caveat only - they wear a bit small in size for me, so I had to order a half-size larger than shoe size.  I'm a 10 1/2 in shoe size, and a size-11 croc fit perfectly.

  I live in Crocs, as almost all other shoes hurt some part of my feet.  I liked the shine of these, rather than the dull finish I am used to.  My friend had crippling arthritis in both feet.  She had to give up all walking.  Her podiatrist told her she could not wear any shoes, ever, other than Crocs.  After she did that, she was able to resume her very long walks.  With that as an example, I wondered if Crocs would work for me - and find that they do.

Very comfortable shoe

  You can't beat the classic clog for comfort.  I'm on my feet a lot in my work, and my feet stay comfortable throughout the shift.  I like to wear a gel insole in them for a little extra padding, and that makes them even more comfortable.  The only downside I find with these shoes is that as they age and the little nubs on the bottom wear off they become very slippery on certain surfaces.  Other than that, they're the perfect shoe for someone on their feet a lot.

  If you're a half size (I am a 6 1/2 in women's), I suggest to go a size up (so for me, a 7 in women's) üòä They would've been too small if I would of went with a 6. They are very comfy and fit nicely, a little knick in the front, but it doesn't affect the shoe at all. They were discounted and sold through Amazon warehouse, other than the very small knick, they're perfect! (fixed with super glue and good as new!)

Perfect for public shoeers
",Jenna Jones,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I bought these for not husband who was stationed in Afghanistan at the time. They had to walk 3.5 minutes to use the toilet or shower. He wore these when he showered and they were perfect because they weren't slippery and protected his feet. Since he has been home, he only wears then for showering at the gym. I personally thing crocs look ridiculous but their function for protecting feet while in a public bathroom is worth it.

  Anyone who has ever bought crocs knows what to expect. Those who have never owned a pair will be impressed. Easy to clean and feel like feathers on your feet. I wear them to work at the hospital and they normally last a year and a half to two years. When the shine starts to fade just slap some liquid car wax on them and they look brand new again. Great for boating or any other outdoor activities as well. The only bad thing is they can be slippery on certain surfaces. Overall a great product.

Perfect for working in at a daycare!
",Zach C.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I bought these for my girlfriend as she‚Äôs been wanting Crocs for work for so long! She works at a daycare and they are required to wear clean shoes inside the rooms. Rather than wearing and tearing gym shoes, some of her coworkers invested in a pair of Crocs dedicated to work only. She finally got her own pair, and now all of her friends at work went out and bought their own pair as well!Glad she was able to get what she needed and they fit perfectly.

Meant to be a bit on the big side... Great water shoes!
",maxjam98,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  If you work around water, these are great.  They keep your from slipping in wet areas and allow your foot to breathe.  They do run very wide, but they are meant to be loose fitting.  The heel strap help keep them on your feet.  When I was a dive instructor, I lived in these things and really liked them -- there just aren't a lot of better options out there and they held up a bit better in the wet conditions than my dock shoes or penny loafers... they are not really pretty though.  :)

  I'm not supposed to go barefoot excessively due to plantar fasciitis, so I bought these Crocs because I was looking for something supportive and easy to slip on that I could wear exclusively inside to avoid tracking dirt through the house (also, they came in size 15, which is hard to find). On the one hand, I love these shoes--they are perhaps the most comfortable I own. On the other hand, they are horrifically ugly. I suppose that works out for the best--it makes it easy to remember that they are for the house only.

  My girlfriend had an old pair of crocs, which I coveted.  So I finally decided to buy myself a pair on amazon. I based my size on the pair my GF had... which tended toward the small size.  As in: her lady size 9 fit my lady size 10 foot.  But when my new crocs arrived in the mail they were too small.  Should've ordered at 10. Which is my foot size.  Let this be a cautionary tale for you, weary traveler: Buy the shoe size you are, not the half-forgotten-dream of a shoe size your girlfriend wears.

  I love these shoes.  they are inexpensive and wear like steel.  I had a pair of black Crocs that I wore to work, wore on the boat fishing, wore to a couple of formal dinners (who looks at peoples feet?)., and use as slippers.  My feet are very sweaty but my Crocs are NEVER hot, never smelly, hardly wear and soft and subtle.  What an incredible invention and wonderful accessories for my aching feet.

Amazing Relaxing Shoes For Hiking and Camping!

  Your browser does not support HTML5 video.


  ¬†I never though about getting crocs until a good friend, who hikes days at a time in Yosemite every year takes crocs with him strapped to his trekking backpack. When I went with him this year I soon realized how awesome the crocs where. Whenever we camped or stopped by a river he would switch out his shoes and socks and slip on the crocs and off he went into the stream, river, or lake with no worries of stepping on rough rocks, sticks or whatever was underneath or rocks and boulders that are above the water. I didn't have any crocs at the time so I had to walk with my bare feet if I wanted to go in. They also made great camping shoes when setting up camp and just relaxing. Needless to say I was convinced and bought some for myself and my wife. We used them on a recent overnight hiking trip. Amazing shoes!

These Duet Sport Men's are longer and wider than the unisex. I usually wear an 8 women's wide and I think I could have used a 5 mens in these instead of the 6 but with socks they still fit. Will be buying more. I think the Duet Sport have a little more cushion than the regular crocs but both are comfortable.

  This is my second set of khaki Crocs, I love them. Perfect footwear around house, going to store, camping, beach even water parks.

I have several Crocs now, will almost certainly always own a few from now on. Only caveat is that they get slippery on smooth surfaces when bottoms gets worn, be careful transitioning from wet out doors to supermarket floors or other smooth surfaces (ATM, etc.)

Durable, yet stylish
",Christy Dvorak,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Bought these for my 10 year old daughter. They are slightly bigger than she needs but she's in between sizes (bigger than the kids sizes but not quite adult) so we knew the fit wouldn't be perfect. She absolutely loves the color and doesn't mind them being a little bigger than she needs. She's had several pairs of kids crocks in the past and they have always withstood everything. (She's not exactly a delicate girl.) Would definitely recommend if your looking for a durable, yet stylish, slip on shoe.

These Crocs Take a Lickin and Keep on Tickin
",Doug Norman,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I bought these for my wife because let's face it, no man looks good in Crocs - not even my Dad and his are camo.  But my wife loves them and wears them mostly outdoors.  They last forever - well, unless you buy yourself a new Labrador puppy.  Then they still last forever - you just can't find them.  At least not until your puppy gets a bit older and decides to bring them back.  Then, bonus, your wife has two pair.

  I do have semi wide feet, so these fit well for me, but people with narrow feet may find them too big. Anyhow, I have a sprained ankle and torn ligament in my foot and needed shoes with high support (with a hard, un-bendable foot-bed). Of the recommended shoes, crocs were the cheapest to be honest. They are very comfortable and supportive. They're the only shoes I can wear right now w/o pain (other than my other pair of crocs).

",Carol Pittman,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Even though the chart said to round down to the nearest size if you wear, for example 8 1/2 go to 8, I went to a 9 since I was going to be wearing thermal socks with them a I ordered them to wear in the winter due to a toe condition. The size 9 fit perfectly with the socks on, but the shoe will probably be a little big to wear without socks in the summer. They are very comfortable shoes. I gave a 4 rather than a 5 star as the straps are a slightly different length on each shoe.

  Same as Crocs sold in stores at the mall. Was glad I didn't have to drive 30 miles to get some! Fit is perfect; however, I wear custom-made orthotics, which slide out the back end (as the back isn't high enough to accommodate them); however, have found if I put 2 stapes from a staple gun straight down into the top of the back part of each shoe (side by side horizontally, but lift the staple up 1/16 of an inch after putting them in), this is just enough to hold the orthotics in, and the staples have not fallen out, even after walking or exercising.

  Crocs are just about the only footwear I can wear, having lots of foot problems, especially since I have wide forefoot and very narrow heel.  The wide forefoot is a result of bone spurs; and shoe mfrs do not make wide shoes with narrow heels, therefore, if I buy wide shoes, they slip off me, but if I buy medium width, my feet would hurt from rubbing on the bone spurs.  This type of Crocs is my answer to my foot problem.

",Jaz,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  This is my third pair I bought, I‚Äôm and 8 1/2 and have crocs in a size 8 and 9. I bought a size 8 and they are made in Mexico and my other 8s are made in Italy.  They are a little more snug and a little stiffer then my Italy ones, I don‚Äôt mind bc I never put them in sport mode. I have another pair from Mexico and they do feel a little different, the ones from Italy are probably the best quality. I still love them tho

My wife hates them...
",John Howard,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  ...but I love them!Crocs have been my 'Go To Shoes' ever since I purchased my first pair about 4 or so years ago.  I don't wear them at work.  With that said, I wear them all the time for everything else. They are on my feet from the time I wake up until I take them off and leave them by the foot of the bed.  On vacation, I even wear them as water shoes when I'm at the beach.  They are soft, comfortable and last forever.  While they aren't the most stylish or shoes. at my age ( 60 year old male) who cares?!Look, if you don't love Crocs, then you just don't get Crocs.  They are kind of quirky and the sizing charts are not standard.  but when you get a pair that fits, you'll understand what all the fuss is about.  You don't have to look at them, you just have to wear them!Love my CROCS.

My first pair of Crocs and I love 'em!
",Little Frog,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  This is my first pair of Crocs and I love them!  I have a wide foot and comfort is key.  Crocs reminded me of the white ""earth shoes"" I wore back in the 70's & 80's while working in the medical field.  I remembered they weren't the most attractive shoes (looked like I had ""duck feet"") but they were comfortable.  I have friends that wear Crocs and decided to give them a try.  I usually wear an 8-1/2 or 9 and was torn between sizes.  Crocs recommends you order down to the next whole size if you are in-between sizes.  I ordered Classic Crocs / size W9 and I thought they were slightly longer than I needed so I ordered an 8 to be sure.  The length of the foot bed for the 8 was fine but I found the toe box to be a little snug on my littlest toe.  I kept the 9's and am glad I did.  I work in an office of a manufacturing plant with a casual dress code. Most of the building has concrete floors and the Crocs are just perfect for me.  I have since bought another pair in a different color and a pair of Crocs sandals.  The Classic Crocs clogs have ventilation so my feet don't get too hot like they might have in some of the closed styles.  I know Crocs have been around a long time and I don't know why it took me so long to try a pair.  I'm very happy I did.

  This is my third pair of crocs in this open style, and I like them very much. I use two canes or a walker for balance due to a bad R hip and the wide soles on these shoes help in that regard. Also, I like the way the heel strap can be pushed toward the front to turn these shoes into slup-ons. My only problem with them is the slant at the back of the heel. If I'm on a slight incline, I must the careful not to lean back too far.

  I had to return the first pair as I ordered the wrong size. If  you wear a ""half size"" order up to the next whole size.I also have  plantar fasciitis and purchased these to wear around  the house. Because of the pain in my heel it was suggested to me I not go barefoot ,which I love.  I needed something really comfortable and the pain in my heel has lessened considerably. I will be ordering other  styles that are a little more fashionable to wear to work.

Great After Foot Surgery!
",ACope,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Had surgery on both feet back in January.  After my first post op visit my doctor suggested roomy shoes, like crocs.  So I purchased the Crocs Classic Clog and I must say that they are roomy and comfortable.  I was glad to get out of the black surgery shoes.  Everything else that I tried to fit into, hurt to slip my foot in and most shoes I couldn't get my foot in due to the swelling and soreness of my feet.  Use Crocs after foot surgery.

They are easy to get on and off (and believe me, with arthritis, that is important).

These are made in Mexico and the fit is very good. I have purchased the Bistro version also
",NKR,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Buying crocs can be a touch and go situation depending on the type and where they are made. These are made in Mexico and the fit is very good. I have purchased the Bistro version also. They are made in China on what appears to be different mold sizes. They tend to be either too tight or too loose, depending on size. This is a shame because they are more attractive without the vent holes.

Weightless, comfy, but tiny break in period
",Sparky,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Newbies: Wearing Crocs is not like wearing shoes. They weigh next to nothing and are cushiony without feeling spongy. Your feet don't have to 'grab' them to stay on: you walk effortlessly, even with the backstrap worn forward over your arch, like clogs. They are waterproof, so the shoes are great for gardening, and the ventilation holes will help your feet breathe; you don't have to wear socks, but I do to avoid any hint of sweaty feet. That's not a real problem for me, but feet vary.  After a short period of wearing them, they become even less noticeable as they conform to your feet. Two days later, most of you won't remember any problems, if you had them. Note: They will wear out eventually, especially if you wear them frequently on concrete. Replace them when the soles wear down, before they become dangerously slippery.Previous users: Remember that new Crocs won't fit like the old ones. The need time to adapt to your feet, particularly the backstrap, which will feel shorter at first.All: Khaki is a wonderful dust color for summer wear. Chocolate is not exactly milk chocolate or bittersweet. It's got a bit of green tinge, which makes it quite attractive for brown feet.

Good croc for size 14 foot - Blu is a good color!
",JThibodo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Wishing crocs came in more interesting colors for large feet (size 14+). This Blue is about it. Nice deep blue that goes well with jeans. Black and brown remind me too much of the shoes I have to wear for work! Still, great around the house shoes or run to town shoes. Very useful in summer if you live in a place where it rains. Doing a lot of kitchen work? These are perfect- like standing on one of those cushion mats you lay down on hard floors.

  I have progressive MS and can no longer keep flipflops on my feet, so I finally tried crocs.  OMG these are wonderful. I can go out in the yard and back in without any problems on any surface.  And, because of the strap at the back, they will never fall off of my feet due to my condition.  Also, I can wear with or without socks.  Love them.

",Barb L,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have a WIDE foot with a HIGH arch & a terrible time finding shoes to fit.  I've worn these constantly for the past 3-4 years except for church & it was time for a new pair.  Haven't quite worn thru the sole, but I was starting to feel rocky ground.  My sister & I both wear the same style.  She is on her feet all day on cement & says it's like walking on a gel mat all day.  Great to find it at such a good price.

Crocs are now my ""go to"" shoe
",GFM,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Have been wearing the Bistro (no holes) model for a year and loving them: light, comfortable, roomy and easy to get on and off--so I thought I would try the perforated model.  I normally take a mens size 10 in other types of shoes, but for both the Bistro and Classic Clog, I got mens size 9 and, for me, they fit perfectly:  Roomy, but stay put on my foot.  Besides the holes, the only other difference between the two models appears to be the tread pattern.  I'm retired and now able to enjoy the opportunity to wear what's comfortable--not what's expected at work.

Fantastic for swollen, pregnant feet
",Roo99,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I'm 7 months pregnant, and in the summer, my feet get very swollen.  I was down to 2 pair shoes that I could wear to work (closed toes shoes) and saw these on sale.  I was looking at Crocs for sometime, but was balking at the $34 price tag.  These were on sale, so I figured I might as well.  Oh, my fat feet are happy.  Good support, and they stretch with my feet throughout the day, so no pinching.  They do seem to shrink overnight, because they don't seem overly large the next day.  Obviously not very fashionable, but I was not looking for fashion, just shoes I could wear in semi-comfort.  I usually wear a 7.5/8 women's, and ordered these in a women's 8, which are fitting well.Additionally, at the end of the day if I need to slip on shoes for whatever reason, these are the only ones which I can stuff my feet into without pain, pinching, or having to try and bend down and adjust straps.  Would highly recommend to people who have swollen feet, looking for comfort and are willing to sacrifice a little fashion for a whole lot of comfort.

Very Comfortable.
",Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Just a word of warning. There are very comfortable. But they tend to run large. They only fit as expected because I bought them a size too small. Usually wear a 9 or 9.5 US, but I wear an 8 in these, and there's lots of toe room. Other than that, I couldn't be happier with them. I've also bought a pair without the holes for ""formal"" occasions. My wife will not let me wear them with my tux, but other than that, she's okay with them.

Old school Croc cushiness, nice and easy on the soles of my feet
",joeguitmo,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Was looking for a pair of crocs that felt like the worn out pair I've been wearing for the last ten years (?).  Went to a shoe store and they all felt too hard and stiff, and not soft and cushy like my old pair.  So after an exhaustive search at Amazon trying to find the same style, I finally found these and they were exactly what I was looking for -- old school croc cushiness, nice and easy on the soles of my feet.

  My first pair lasted for years so I finally got a second pair and still love the original crocs!  They make an active lifestyle so much easier!  I mostly wear them for working around the house and walking around in and I love them as backup travel shoes for camping or hanging around the hotel.  I tried other crocs but most other styles, although better looking, just aren't as flexible and soft as these originals.

Very comfortable. Great for my intended uses to replace flip ...
",Lewis R.,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Very comfortable. Great for my intended uses to replace flip flops and to dry my feet out after walking around in boots or being wet all day.  However, the site suggested going up half a size if you are inbetween. I generally wear a 9.5 military boot or a 10 in regular shoes. I went with a 10, and the back strap barely catches on my heel as I take a step.  Fine for walking around on dry ground, indoors, at the pool etc.  However, it's a bit too large to walk around in muck, submerged water (creeks etc) because it just isn't tight enough.  If I purchased again I would actually go down half a size.

  I have plantar faciitis, which is especially painful when standing on hard surfaces like the tile in our kitchen. I got the Crocs primarily as a slipper for around the house. They cushion my feet quite a bit and are comfortable. They're a little big as I expected they would be, but not uncomfortable. I suspect if I ran in them, they might fall off. They're ugly, but they look tons better than the stupid flip flops that everyone wears around here.

  I ordered these shoes for my husband for Christmas.  He is so clueless when it comes to comfortable footwear.  He only buys these big ol' New Balance shoes, in extra wide, from Big 5 when they go on sale.  He has started to have lower back pain and I think it's because of his choice of footwear.  He's a big guy... retired football coach.  He says he loves the way the shoes fit.  His only problem is how they look.  Says he'll wear them, but he just can't look down at them.  And to avoid being attacked ""Duck Dynasty style"", I will not tell what he says when he does happen to glance down at his feet...

From a Catholic to a Crocoholic
",Ariana,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Let me start by saying one thing: I never thought I would own crocs.Here is my coming of Croc story.I always thought these shoes were so ugly. I first saw them about 8 years ago and thought ""Why would someone ever put something like that on their feet?"" and people would always say how comfortable they were. I just thought they were dumb to think wearing this shoe was okay.Well go into the futre to now, I am a graduate nurse whos feet are killing her on 12hr shifts. So I decide to give them a try.Now I am a converted crocoholic. I love these shoes, I even made my other new nurse friends buy them lolThey are honestly so comfortable on my feet, and when unsightly things spill on them, you can just wipe them off.I also love that you may or may not use the strap in the back, sometimes I like to be scandalous and let my heels out and other times I like to wear the straps around my ankles (call me bojangles).But for real, if you have never tried these before, you should. They are worth the one time try- and then you will be addicted.

",Missouri Mom,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I go stocking-footed in the house most of the time, and needed something that I could slip into quickly when I wanted to go outside.  These clogs are great!  They are comfortable (I have bunions and need extra space), and well-made.  I don't feel the gravel underfoot in these Crocs, like I have with similar knock-off clogs.  White is not the best color for clumping around in a farm lot, but they are easy to clean with cleanser.

Crocs are what I wear
",K. Means,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have mostly only worn Crocs Clogs since early 2009 as a result of a medical condition.  I can easily put these on and they're fairly comfortable.  I'm not sure why, but there have been different sizing schemes over the years ranging from XL, Men's 10-11, and Men's 11.  I have many colors and will continue to use them.  I feel like they're expensive, but they're worth it.

Classic Croc Indeed
",KSA,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Good quality, the same one we just had to replace after my husband wore them for about 4 years - daily (none of his other shoes last that long), it is true to size (the men's 13 actually fits my husband's 13 wide foot) and the price on Amazon was the lowest I could find anywhere on the web (Crocs don't seem to go on sale very often). Combined with the free shipping - a perfect deal.

They are great gardening or on-the-run shoes that give support and protection, but can be tossed about anywhere as they're nearly indestructible! In time their tread will wear down, and you could continue to use them, but because their not costly, I just replace them. I wear mine nearly daily, and they last well for 2 years+.

Comfy sandals, but gets dirty easily
",j&a,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are great casual lightweight sandals that are cushy and mold to your feet.  They are also great for wearing in/around water.  I bought a pair for myself and my hubby, who loves his as well.  Our only complaint is that these sandals get dirty easily.  We both got black, so it is always a little dusty on the outside (makes it look like dark grey), and when we wear around the yard or around town, we often get dust, pebbles, and grass in our shoes.  I suppose if you wore them where there was zero debris on the ground, they'd be the perfect shoes!  They are also easy to clean, however - just damp paper towel or cloth wipes it clean.  Fairly good traction below, too.

They are Crocs...what more needs to be said?
",Drsuis,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have been wearing Crocs for a long time.  This is my first review.  I am a large man with wide feet.  I have a bad knee that makes tying shoes very painful.  Slip-on mules and clogs are the ticket for me, and Crocs are the answer.  Whenever they go on sale, I consider buying another pair.  The only downside is that the sole tread seems to wear out to quickly in my opinion.  I like the quick and free shipping with Amazon Prime.

",Sydney Scott,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I've never worn Crocs before this, but I love them! They fit the shape of my foot perfectly-narrow at the heal, wide at the toes. And the sole make these shoes almost soundless on tile or wood floors-helpful when you don't want to wake up people or dogs.

Happy Feet
",PaulC,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  My feet are happy in Crocs - I wear them all year round, with socks when it's cooler. I rarely need to use the back strap, so I leave it folded forward to make them easy slip on/off.  My feet are able to breathe in Crocs so there isn't a build up of sweat to cause odor issues.  So maybe they're not so stylish but I don't care, they are comfortable which counts much more with me.

",Angelin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Love my holey Crocs. Suggested by my doctor years ago since I am diabetic (for 22 years). I wear them year around 90% of the time. With socks during the winter only changing to boots when outside in snow conditions.  Holes provide necessary air circulation and the wide toe bed prevents toe compression. I have never had a problem with my feet. You won't hear many diabetics say that.

Slip on and off
",Gramps,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I go back and forth from my shop maybe fifteen times day.  To avoid tracking in dirt or sawdust into the house, these can be kicked off and put back on without bending over.  If you need to do something that requires good footing you probably want to put on something more substantial with laces.  Because of their fit they can slip off sometimes too easily so be aware that they're not appropriate for all activities.

  The toe box was a little tight and using the straps in the back makes the whole shoe tight. There was no way to choose a production site, so that was a little disappointing.

",Kindle Customer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I had a pair of croc sandals a few years back and they were very comfortable.  I wore them frequently.  I wanted something I could wear around the house during the cold weather. I don't like wearing shoes or sneakers when I'm inside and slippers cause my feet to get too hot - not very supportive either.  So remembering my comfortable croc sandals I decided to try a clog.  I'm so glad that I did.  I can wear them w/or without socks and they are very comfortable.  I have happy feet and that makes me very happy!

  Got myself a new pair of crocs to celebrate getting a new job. They fit wonderfully and are so comfy. Bought a size up from what I usually wear, cause that‚Äôs what the croc website recommends. Been wearing them everyday since I got them. Yellow is such a light color, so they tend to get dirty easily but nothing a little soap and water can‚Äôt fix.

  If you like Crocs, you will like this show.  The only tough part was working through all of the confusing shoe sizing systems!  It took about 1/2 hour to make sure that I was ordering the right thing.  Amazon should create a web page where you enter your normal US size, indicate gender, and then it will automagically tell you which Croc to buy.

Easy to clean if you mistakenly step in something left ...
",Tim Robson,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Works for a quick slip-on for taking the dog outside. Easy to clean if you mistakenly step in something left behind by another dog in the dark (because yours would never do that to you).I would prefer if they had half sizes, or width selection, though. A 13.5/EE would probably fit perfectly, while this gives me a touch more front to back wiggle than I normally like.

I live in Phoenix, so that is actually a really big deal - I used to take my shoes off for the drive home to keep them from getting so hot, and you really aren't supposed to drive barefoot! The squishy foam is quite comfortable as well. Some flooring materials (laminate specifically) will make these squeak when walking, but not much different from my danskos honestly. They are totally silent on tile and linoleum. Wish I had bought these years ago for summers!

",Larry Lincoln,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Crocs have a useful purpose in our busy lives.  My sister who passed away from cancer this past year and had feet swelling because of the chemo could only wear Crocs near the end of her life.  A nurse I know well wears them every day because of teh comofot and for me,, I wear them because I can wear them in the yard, wash them off when I am finished and they are no worse for the wear.

I wear these during homecoming at school every year and I always get so many compliments on them. They are so comfortable and it takes a LONG time to wear out. I have another pair that I've had for a couple of years and they haven't even started to wear out. I recommend these to everyone no matter the age or size.

  I wear a size 10 in most mens shoes, but a size 9 in Crocs fits me perfectly; so the fit is ""as expected"", but not accurate to normal US shoe sizing.  I love these things; this is my second pair, and I wore my first pair until the bottom was bald and one of the straps came off on one side.  Figured I should pony up for a new pair.

  The product itself is good, though the sizing was confusing. I typically wear 10.5-11 size shoes, but knew that these were on the wider side, so I initially ordered a men's size 10. Even the 10s were way too wide and would slip off my feet, however, so I returned them for this size 9. Now the length is a little cramped, but the width is still generous.

",Kris Smith,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These fit accurately and are super comfortable. I had my last pair for 7 years until they finally gave in w/ a considerable amount of abusive wear. I recommend these for gardeners, chefs or anyone on their feet for long periods of time. They are easily cleaned; they can go in the washing machine, be hosed off or worn in the shower. This purchase may not impress fashionistas, but your feet will thank you.

  I tried this shoe on in a store, so I knew to order 1 size smaller than usual. My normal size would also have been okay, but with perhaps a little more play than might be comfortable-particularly if you were going to use as a slip-on (strap in front).The comfort of the material is to be experienced to be believed. I will definitely be buying another pair when the time is right.

As comfy as they are ugly !
",Berta Dora,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I really like my clogs. I just don't like the way they look. And I wouldn't have considered them but I had to travel very light at some point and was jealous of a friend's clogs that served her well. The weight is amazingly low. So I tried them on and they are so comfy. First I didn't buy any because locally they are rather pricey but then I found them on amazon for a very reasonable price. I only wear them at home because I think they are really ugly but at home I wear them all the time. The are great for the garden because you can just hose them off if they get muddy. They are great for inside because they don't slip and the material warms up fast in the winter to keep my feet warm. The are treated with something antibacterial so they don't start to smell in the summer when your feet are sweaty. And they are made in Mexico which I prefer over made in China, for some reason including the short way to transport them. I like the strap in the back too. It is good if you have to walk further with them (which I usually don't but it is good to have options).

Citrus - Nice, uncommon color
",Tom of NYC,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I prefer Crocs to their $1 to $7 knock-offs. The patented Croslite material of Crocs conform to your feet after a day or two, and is much more durable than the material used in inexpensive knock-offs.Still, I wish Crocs weren't so much longer and wider than their stated size. The extra roomy fit can cause a lot of slippage when the Crocs get wet.

The  little holes allow your feet to breath and cleared up my athletes foot. But one does need shoe cover with high risk patients with excessive body fluids !  Awesome for day to day use too.

  I had a pair of crocs years ago, then my puppy chewed them up. I ordered these primarily for van camping, as it's nice to have a pair of shoes to slide in and out of easily. I find that I wear them as house shoes, garden shoes, after hiking shoes. I need to order a second pair! I've tried other molded plastic shoes, but the other brands are too narrow and the toe box is shallow. These are nice with socks or bare foot. So many colors to choose from!

",Heather C,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I ordered these for my 12 year old. If you have never ordered before, the sizing is slightly larger than most. I think it is partly due to the boxy design of the shoe also. My son wears these as his regular shoe all summer long. I don't know if that is good for your feet or not but it does make for cool feet and easy to clean shoes. You can't go wrong with this classic!

* PERFECT SHOWER SHOES!
",Joe,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  When I deployed to Iraq back in 2008, I bought these to use as shower shoes.  They worked very well offering a decent grip on the shower floor.  I used them for an entire year while I was deployed and they held up great.  Not just in the shower trailers, but also when  walking on the desert ground that was super hot.  After using them in Iraq, I decided to just throw them out as I wasn't about to bring them home after using everyday in public showers.  Upon my return I bought another pair that I wear to go outside or down in my basement.  I give 4 stars only because the sizing is a little off.  I am a 9.5 so I ordered size 9 which was too small.  I returned that pair, with ease might I add thanks to Amazon free return, and ordered a size 10.  The size 10 is slightly too big but not to the point where it's annoyingly coming off my foot.  The back strap does the job in keeping them on my feet.I highly recommend these Crocs.  They are a perfect shower shoe due to the almost rubberish material.  They will not deteriorate.  Also great little slip on shoes for camping as well for treks to and from the community shower house.  Enjoy!

comfy but no traction
",emwall,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are super comfortable shoes and I use them all the time. The back strap on one of the shoes I received is too short to fit properly over the foot cover if you flip it forward rather than having it behind your heel.  This bothers me as I use these as outdoor shoes and leave the strap up so that I can slide them on and off easily.  I live abroad so it wasn't worth trying to return them.  The other downside is that they have no traction and slip easily on slick/wet surfaces.  I love them though, and use them all the time and would buy more in the future.

",Krystal Campbell,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are my first real pair of Crocs and I am pleasantly surprised how comfortable the insoles are - especially since years ago I tried a pair and didn't like the Crocs style insoles. After years of wearing Danskos, I decided to give the Crocs another try and am happy for it. I've always had knock-off Crocs that didn't have the insoles and now I understand (and feel) the difference. I have an office job, so I am not on my feet all day - I mainly wear these around the house or occasionally on the weekends.

Can't beat it for $24.
",Noah,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Some folks in here complained that their Crocs seemed to be bad imitations, but these seem to be genuine Crocs, and they're great. I usually wear an 11.5 or 12 in most shoes, but I ordered 12s and they were way too big. The 11 fits fine, although it IS a bit wide. Maybe should have gone for the narrow, although I typically am a regular-width foot. Just some advice on the fit ‚Äì I'm quite happy with these butt-ugly Crocs.

They are the only shoes I can be on my feet all day with and not feel any foot discomfort. It would be ideal if they were slip resistant, but I'll be okay.

  I followed a suggestion in a review that informed others that Crocs often run a tad larger than normal shoe size. I bought these for my husband, who usually wears size 10.5.  There are no half sizes, so I wasn't sure which way to go.  Wound up buying the size 10, and indeed, the shoe fits! Very relieved. My husband loves them.

They didn't have an 11.5, so I went with the 12 knowing it would be big, but it's a tad bit bigger than I thought. They still fit fine and since I am using them to walk across gravel to a shower in a war zone, they are easier to get on and off. Much better durability than my flip flops that fell apart.

",damasi,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I purchased these to replace my fianc√©'s worn-out classic clogs. The reason they fit as expected is because I knew to get a smaller size this time. His shoe size is 10.5 and the old pair were 11's and quite large. Maybe because he doesn't use the heel strap? He prefers to flip it to the top of the clogs and wear them as a slip-ons. Went with a size 10 and they fit very nicely. 5 stars because he's so pleased to have a new pair of Crocs that actually fit.

Classics are the ONLY Crocs
",Will B.,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I've had 'em all and I keep returning to the Classic Crocs. Best shoe, despite any argument ANYONE has, I've ever owned. I have countless pair to the dismay of those around me... and I LOVE THEM.Since I like them so much here's some Crocs Classic info.They are great just about everywhere. I can accomplish just about every chore I do in them. They are worthless once they get water in them. (two pair and a towel nearby when gardening, really? ...hahah) So, they dry quickly.They aren't for bouldering or climbing trees but they can make it most places on a job site, trail walking, house and yard wearing.Classics are great because of the holes in the front for shaking out constant debris. Classics are affordable, but they all are relatively... these are just the best. More comfortable than the Rx pair, better than the rugged outdoor pair, night and day better than any of the fleece-lined winter ones. Get the Classics and forget the rest. ~ Cheers.

Most comfortable shoes ever
",Mary D,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I've been wearing crocs for years, starting with the original beach clogs and now the classic clogs.  They've spoiled me for any other shoe- I wear them to weddings, funerals, and everywhere in between.  In the winter I wear the dreaded sock-and-croc combo; in the summer I go au naturel in my crocs.  It's all good.

Comfort needs to be engineered back into the product
",Wilson Lee,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I bought these to replace a pair I bought 18 years ago. As others have noted, the current ""Classic"" model is made with a stiffer material than the original...this is absolutely correct. I prefer the softer original, but I'm pretty sure the copycats don't make the soft ones anymore, either. These are also slightly narrower, and the raised rubber nubs feel pointier (maybe because of the stiffer rubber?). Otherwise, these are almost identical to the 18 year old model. I usually like to buy products from the innovator, even if they're more expensive than the copycats, so I may buy these again in the future. On the other hand, the most desirable features have been pretty much designed out of the product, so, when it comes time to replace these, I may go with an entirely different product.

  I have no idea if it's just me, but I normally wear a size 12 boot, sandal, sneaker, dress shoe, slipper, you name it! But these, for a size 12, were at LEAST two sizes two big, unless you're supposed to wear them with winter socks! Maybe I don't understand the style and they're supposed to be uncomfortably huge. I exchanged for a size 11 due to the fact that amazon's selection process for these is confusing and leaves much to be desired. However, after returning these and the size 11's I had to order size 10's from eBay. The return process was simple and I got 100% back, including shipping!Otherwise very comfortable.

I understand that some of these are made in the U.S. and some are made in China and Mexico. This pair was made in Mexico.  Not bad for $20.00.  Would buy again.

Crocs around the house, with or without socks
",Wandering Philosopher,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I love Crocs, because they're easy to slip on and off, and because they're washable. I pretty much live in them around the house. Of course, I don't know whether or not they're somehow contributing to my back pain. And I think it probably took a while for me to learn to walk in them without tripping a little now and then -- there is a little extra length in them, but I think they are supposed to fit that way.This might be the most recent pair I bought, and it's almost two years old. I don't remember whether or not it was the case with them, but over the years I remember that on at least a couple of occasions new Crocs smelled when I first received them. Can't remember exactly, but it might be sort of a fruity smell. I don't *think* it washes out, at least not in one wash, but I think it dissipates over time. I think we used to leave them to air out for a while before wearing them. My sense of smell is sometimes annoyingly sensitive, so this might not pose a problem for the average person, especially if you keep your feet away from your (and anyone else's) nose.Roomy enough to wear with socks when my feet are cold, which is another reason to prefer them over my pink fabric slides. (Those are really awkward with socks).

I like 'em for playing drums (and just about other general purpose use).
",Professional Product Review Service,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Fit great!  I used my old pair so much for practically everything that they became 'outdoor' Crocs.  I ordered this pair for my 'indoor' Crocs.A few things I really like about them, and a slightly different perspective than the norm: I love them for playing drums!  Sometimes the kick drum beater swings back and hits the top of my foot, which hurts.  The layer of plastic 'armor' that the Crocs provide eliminates that pain.  The sole isn't too grippy and the shoes are very light weight, so switching between the hi-hat and second kick pedal is easy and comfortable, too.  Great for playing drums!

About right for size, wish had 1/2 sizes
",ConnieMH,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  These are good, basic crocs.  I do wish they had half sizes. I know the 9s will stretch a little with wear. The sole is actually about right, but the strap is a bit shorter so it feels a bit snug. 10s are a bit too sloppy (big)  for me.

Not fashionable but very functional
",rkb,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  After accidentally losing the nail on my big toe, the doctor recommended Crocs to protect my foot while allowing the wound to properly air. I borrowed a shoe from my housemate (one size too big) and ordered a pair for myself. I wear a 7 1/2 and the size 7 fits just fine. I am on my feet all day and this shoe allows my feet to breathe and keeps them comfortable. I think they will be my everyday shoe from now on- so much safer than the rubber thongs that were my habit. They are easy to rinse off after working in the yard and you can throw them in the dishwasher if you want to sanitize them. Ugly but smart!

These fit well, if a bit loose as do most Crocs of this style.  She uses the strap around her heal to keep them on;  she's not a ""slide"" sandal gal.  Highly recommended.

This is THE most comfortable shoe that you can wear for this long
",J.Allen,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I work in medicine and am on my feet 10-12 hours or more daily.  This is THE most comfortable shoe that you can wear for this long.  Athletic shoes have great support, but they strangle your feet and they suffocate.  These are FOAM shoes.  They are roomy and comfy and your feet breatheeeeeeeee. Other options are the Birkenstock clogs, but they are HEAVY as heck.  These are light as a feather.One thing to consider is where they are made.  I have had a few pairs of the same size and they all fit VERY VERY differently.  My previous pair was ""made in China"" and though they were size 8, they fit like a 9.  Too wide and too long.  I got used to them and used them for years.  These here IIRC are ""made in Mexico"" and they fit as a size 8 should.  At first I thought they were too small, but I was used to the ones that were too large. I read somewhere that different factories may have different molds for the same shoe.  It feels weird having ones that touch the sides of my feet, but they will break in and comform to my feet.  They are after all, foam.

Comfortable Footwear for Problem Feet
",Designer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I've had neuropathy for 10 years and usually wear flip flops because shoes and socks exacerbate the symptoms. These Crocs are the most comfortable shoes I've found for this problem.

Non-slip sole is a great protection
",Sameh Shoukry,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Many times I slipped in the shower either at home or at the gym, beside on wet store-floors on rainy days but after I bought this product I have the peace of mind because the non-slip sole is a great protection. I love this product, it's worth the money. The only thing I would like the manufacturer to change in this product is the strong smell of new rubber that stays for weeks. I'm planning to buy more of those Crocs in different colors.Please note that not all of this Crocs are non slip, make sure it's non-slip before you buy.

  I normally wear a 7 1/2 Med. in women's shoes (used to be a 7). These fit my foot length when I add an arch support but, just barely. However, I don't think I would want them any bigger since I only wear then in the house and usually I have bare feet.

  I really wanted to have a pair of Crocs.  It seems like everyone who has a pair loves them.  Unfortunately, they do not fit well for me.  Even with a smaller size than I usually wear, they made my feet look huge.  The just seemed to slip off of my feet.  I wish I could wear them.  They have a reputation for easy fit and style.

Difficulty with Crocs' Online Sizing Tool
",NorCal Stu,4.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I've enjoyed Crocs for years -- tough, durable, water-proof, comfortable, even stylish. I've always purchased them in a store but ordered online just because I knew exactly what I wanted -- or thought I did until the pair I received through Amazon was a full size too big (even though the size imprinted in the shoe was identical to prior Crocs I've owned that fit well). The second (replacement) pair, sze 9M/11W, fit very well, even though I wear size 10M. As I noted upon returning the first pair, Crocs' sizing tool is not user-friendly and resulted, despite my best effort, in my having to return the first pair. Like most folks, I'm only going to re-order replacement shoes online if they are going to be VERY consistent in their size and width -- otherwise, I'll go to a store for the traditional try-on method of shopping. Since Crocs are not very expensive and available everywhere, I'm actually going to go to a store for try-ons in the future, even though Amazon's system for returns and replacing is excellent. Amazon did a great getting me the right size; my disappointment is with Crocs, who in my view make a great line of products but have a clunky and unreliable sizing system that, for me at least, made ordering online a disappointing experience.

  I typically wear a 6.5 size shoe and I ordered the 6 after reading the comment about them running large. It is a perfect fit for me but may be too snug for some. I love these shoes so far though!

Third Pair - Great Crocs
",Steve from WV,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  I have had three pair of these exact CROCS. I keep buying black because I have the red straps from a University of Maryland set that are no longer made, and they are easily transferred (with a little soapy solution to lubricate) from one pair to the next.

Lov these
",Charles D. Martin,5.0 out of 5 stars,"

  Been wearing these for years. Very comfortable. Only problem I have is the strap breaks off, the little plastic thing that it snaps into seems to fall off after a year or so, and of course you can never find it again, so I end buying another pair. Usually worn enough that I do not mind a new pair.

  Everyone in my family has these crocs in various colors.  We use them all the time since we live in Florida.  Great to take on a cruise.  Like any product they get warn.  Ours get heavy heavy use so I replace them maybe once every 18 months.  With normal use they should last much longer.
