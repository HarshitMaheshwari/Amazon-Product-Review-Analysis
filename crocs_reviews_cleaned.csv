Outdoor Enthusiast!,Not the good made in USA ones of years ago,"  I have worn Crocs for years, but the well-made ones that came from the USA (Colorado) many years ago.  These made in China ones are a harder plastic and extremely wide so that my feet slip around in them or the shoes fall off.  They also aren't anywhere near as comfortable due to the harder plastic, even if they did fit properly.  I have already started the return process, very disappointed since after many years, my American made ones are finally starting to wear out and need replacing",1, Grass Green,9.0,7.0,367,2018
MoMo Wondertoes,Two completely different sized shoes marked the same size,  We have been buying crocs for a long time and this time we received crocs that were marked the right size .... but one was significantly smaller and more narrow than the other. This was something we only realized after leaving on vacation. Our 12 year old constantly complained that the one was too small and the other was too large. He had to wear them until we could find a store to buy him flip flops and so we couldn't return them by the time we got back as they had been worn. Not sure what happened here but I have them and they are definitely two different sizes...,1, Black,7.0,5.0,327,2017
PJM,Love Crocs but....,"  I was hoping these would fit like the Classic Clog Crocs I already have but, they still feel too small.  It's the third pair I've ordered lately and can't seem to find the fit I was hoping for.  Ended up donating these and the others to Value Village since I had worn them a couple of times.  None of them seemed as roomy as the ones I have almost worn out.  I love Crocs but am frustrated trying to find the right fit!",1, Navy,9.0,7.0,157,2018
Shemit,Not buying Crocs.,"  I would never recommend the now-a-day Crocs clogs to anyonecrocs Unisex Classic Clog,Black,5 M US Men's / 7 M US Women's  . I have worn a pair of Crocs clogs for over 10 years and decided it was time to replace them. The clogs now are nothing like the clogs of years ago. And sad to say the quality of what was a great buy is gone. This clog is now a plastic of some sort and the insole is not any more comfortable than a regular pair of shoes. I normally wear 6.5US and got a size 7. They are tight across the foot when using the strap, my foot is pushed forward and is uncomfortable. But without the strap the clog doesn't seem to fit right. Sorry to say I will not be buying Crocs clogs anymore.",1, Black,7.0,5.0,154,2017
Amazon Customer,Didn't last a month,"  I bought these to replace an earlier pair which were just great, and which I wore for two years.  These were the exact same size and style as before (different colour only).I received these on October 4th, 2018.  Photo taken November 2nd, 2018.  That is less than a month.  You can draw your own conclusions from a glance at the photo.Also, this pair seemed smaller/tighter than the original pair, despite supposedly being the exact same size.

Kathleen Stewart,Not a good Croc,"  These are a cheap Crocs.  They have no arch support like the better Crocs do, the rubber is hard and not flexible and soft like other Crocs.  And they are much too large for a womens B width foot.  In fact, these Crocs actually hurt my feet and legs when I wore them out.  I will never wear these Crocs again.  In fact, I am taking them to Goodwill today and I just got them!I have 2 pairs of older Crocs that cured my Achilles tendinitis and plantar facshitis (spelling sorry), that mold to my feet and are so soft and cushiony and non slip.I think alot of what's wrong with these Crocs is the unisex thing.

The new ones are made much cheaper and smaller, and the harder plastic is more uncomfortable. There is no more padded arch or footbed (insole), and they are just downright uncomfortable compared to the nice soft, thicker rubber they used to make them with. What happened Crocs?

Kindle Customer,Quality has fallen,"  I bought a pair supposedly in the same style and size as my original pair from 8 years ago.  The change was both startling and disappointing.The size of the new pair is visibly smaller than my original pair.The little rise at the back of the footbed is almost non-existent so my feet slide out backwards as I walk.The nubs on the footbed are so coarse it's like walking barefoot on gravel.Overall, they are very tight compared to the originals.

This is a recurring problem that is usually improved by wearing Crocs.  I took a closer look at the shoes and was shocked to see that they aren't real.

Dahak72,Not a Roomy Fit!,"  I don‚Äôt know what to tell you. Crocs are dead to me. I have searched high and low for the elusive roomy fit crocs that I first purchased about five years ago. They were made in Mexico of a somewhat softer material than the new ones I find now. After much research, I thought the Classic Crocs were the ticket with their ‚Äúroomy fit‚Äù description.

Leslie Kain,Orange!!,  February 2019 Review:Shoes fit perfectly but there was a weird orange stain on them I saw when I first opened the package. Possibly used shoes and then resold?September 2019 Review:I love love love my crocs but I have only had them for 7 months and now they are completely turning orange. I have no idea how they are turning orange and I really wish I had the clean sleek white croc color as appeared in the product ad.  I could see your crocs possibly turning green if you walk in the grass a lot with them on but orange!? I have nothing in my home or outside that would explain this. Super sad to see my first pair of crocs not even last a year. First two images are when I first opened package and next two images are updates I took this morning. :(,1, White,7.0,5.0,11,2019
Vick DeGiorgio,Crocs has apparently decided to save money on materials by ...,"  Crocs has apparently decided to save money on materials by shrinking the shoes. These are a full 1/2 inch shorter and 3/8 inch narrower than the same size ones they were intended to replace. I have returned them. I'm hesitant to order a larger size as they are also narrower, so I guess after 15 years of wearing them, I will have to find another shoe.",1, Black,14.0,12.0,25,2017
Joy,FAKE,"  DO NOT buy these crocs if you are looking for the real deal, they are huge and the holes are the wrong size/ in the wrong places. They look fine on their own, but compared with real ones they are obviously fake. Spend the extra 5-10 dollars on real ones from the store or Crocs website.",1, Black,8.0,6.0,14,2018
Judith E. Oakland,What's halppend to Crocs?,"  I wish I had believed the comments about various size differences according to country of manufacture.  The Crocs I've always purchased in the past ran at least a size too large and very wide.  So, I ordered a size smaller than I usually wear; but the Croc slip-on I received is like a woman's size 8 regular (and I wear and 11 wide).  I can't even get my foot into it.  I guess I'll have to branch out to another brand of footwear that's more reliable.  I hate returning things and I usually just take the loss, but these are going back.",1, Black,10.0,8.0,10,2018
Janet Mustain,Uncomfortable,"  I got these because I wanted something that could get wet, without needing to dry forever like tennis shoes, for when I have to take the dogs for their morning walk, and still protect my toes and provide some arch support. I should never have bought them.First, if you have wide feet, just don't bother.  I ordered the Men's 9, because I wear an 11 Wide in Women's shoes.  HA!  These were barely long enough and tighter than any other man's shoe I've ever tried on before.  I wear men's tennis shoes because I have wide feet, but these shoes are very narrow for men's shoes.Second, your feet will sweat in these like crazy.  If you thought your feet sweat in your workout shoes, just wait till you wear these for a few minutes in the heat.  I have feet that sweat, not as bad as some people I know, but still, I like a shoe that breathes.Third, the little nubs that are supposed to keep your feet from slipping are very hard and unpleasant on the bottom of your feet and, even though this shoe runs small, your foot will slip around once it starts to sweat or gets wet.These are now shower shoes only, and that is a lot of money to spend on something you can only wear to take a shower.",1, Tangerine,11.0,9.0,5,2020
ruth croghan R.Ph.,Obviously counterfeit product,  I have owned Crocs in the past and these were not of the same quality. The left show was significantly larger than the right. The shoes were a slightly different color. PLEASE read the negative comments before purchasing! I did but was swayed but the amount of 3 + star ratings and failed to read the negative comments which matched what i experienced. Buy at your own risk. These were not made in the USA rather in Vietnam.,1, Pepper,10.0,8.0,6,2020
Kindle Customer,Uncaring company!,"  I am very upset! I spent $45.00 purchasing these to wear a month!??!! The first time I cleaned them in hot, soapy water.....by morning when I put them on my feet, the left one had shrunk CONSIDERABLY. The right one only a little. Regardless, I cannot wear them now. The left foot is too short and it squeezes my foot as it became very narrow and snug!So be careful cleaning them. You may have regrets like myself! What a waste of my money!!!**ordered a second time because I loved the heel cushioning these offered up until the left foot shrunk. We shall see how the second pair work out. So far, so good but I haven't attempted to clean them either.  I will update after I do. I have to say I am absolutely DISGUSTED I have not heard from the seller! So even if this second pair works out, I will never give them more than one star. That is extremely poor customer relations. Obviously once they have your money, they could care less if you have an issue with your shoes.",1, Neo Mint,13.0,11.0,2,2020
Candace,Toe box not nearly as high as previous Crocs,"  I have one pair of Crocs, ordered from Amazon in 2008.  This year, they got full of paint due to painting our house.  There still is nothing wrong with them other than the paint.  So, I decided to treat myself to a new pair.  The new ones are stiff, the nubs on the inside hurt and the toe box really wants to yank off my baby toenail, even though I trim them weekly.  Returning.  Way to screw up a great product, Crocs.  I soaked my old ones in soap and water overnight, dried them in the sun, stuffed newspaper inside and gave them 2 coats of Rustoleum flat black spray paint.  Viola!  Like new.  I am now a former Crocs customer.  The old ones fit like a glove and are the most comfy shoes I own.",1, Black,10.0,8.0,4,2019
Frank,Sizing Inconsistencies (maybe based on region of manufacture),"  This was my first pair of Crocs. I'm a men's size 8 in almost all brands of sneakers, so ordered my normal size. When these arrived, they were massive. My feet were swimming in them, and I could rattle them around by shaking my feet, heel straps engaged. But, I read that Crocs are supposed to be very loose, and just rolled with it. They never felt right, and so I decided to stop by a local Crocs store to make sure. The Crocs at the retail store in the same size/model were completely different. Since I had them both, I was able to compare and the Amazon ones felt and looked more like a size 9 or 10. I thought maybe they were fakes, but they were sold directly by Amazon and looked legit. The only difference I could tell was the retail store ones were made in Vietnam, whereas the Amazon ones were Brazil. So maybe they have very different injection molds at each location that cause for the size inconsistencies. Luckily, Amazon allowed me to return them and I bought a properly fitting size 8 pair of Crocs, made in Vietnam.",3, Black,10.0,8.0,3,2019
Wedoidos,Not like original Crocs!!,"  I‚Äôm a nurse and wore Crocs for years. Love them, they‚Äôre ugly but sooooo comfortable. I retired and gave all my Crocs away ‚òπÔ∏èI decided I needed 1 pair to go to Disney World so I ordered these and was so excited to get them but...... they are NOT nearly as comfortable as original Crocs, in fact they hurt my feet without thick socks. The little nubs in the sole are kinda sharp and the shoes are not cushy.So disappointed ‚òπÔ∏è I‚Äôm at Disney and my feet aren‚Äôt happy.",3, Khaki,8.0,6.0,3,2020
Mommy LoCo,"Like big fuzzy pink slippers, only, not.","  Sigh, I expected to love these. My boys are so obsessed with their crocs that they practically live in them. My mother also insists they are the only shoe comfortable enough for all day wear for working on her feet all day. However, I immediately noticed how big they look. I slipped them on, hoping they would look less large, but no, they looked like little boats for my feet. I figured this would be ok, mostly wearing these for stream play, but they are constantly filling with sand and little pebbles. So of course, that is not a great quality in shoes dedicated to stream play. However, when I was brave enough to wear these ridiculous slippers out in public, the squeaked with every single step. Given their high price tag, I‚Äôm pretty disappointed.",3, Lavender,8.0,6.0,1,2020
Jona,Not the real thing,"  I have purchased several pairs of crocs in the past, and this pair was supposed to be exactly identical to a pair I had previously purchased on Amazon. I actually clicked ""Buy it again"" on that previous order.These are not the same shoes. The new one is way too tight, and just a couple weeks after getting them and leaving them outside for a few days under the elements, they are now bent. The pair I purchased in the past stayed outside much longer, and is still in perfectly good condition. I seriously doubt these are real Crocs, or Crocs has recently drastically lowered the quality of their products. Crazy that this is sold by Amazon. Seriously?",1, Black,13.0,11.0,3,2020
Samantha,Very wide!,  These are much stiffer and wider than the Crocs from past years. The length was fine but they were wide boats on my feet! Since the description didn't say they're wide I was expecting the same snug feel they used to. They went back right away. The Crocs website says their shoes are available in narrow sizes but I haven't found them anywhere online in narrow.,3, Navy,8.0,6.0,3,2020
krafty pixie,Back Strap Is Sized Bigger Than Shoe,"  I have loved Crocs & have bought countless pairs. This pair was defective. The back strap was clearly a size larger than the shoe itself. It was raised up & did not fit flush when it rested on the top of the shoe & was longer then the shoe back than it should be. I will be returning these & not ordering any more from this seller or any other. Crocs have been going downhill for a while- not lasting as long as they used to, etc. I was hoping the quality had improved, but apparently it's just getting worse.",1, Garnet,6.0,4.0,3,2020
Teacher/Business Owner,Hideous Cheesy Feet,"  I got these because someone recommended them for wearing around the house on our hard tile floors. We take off our outdoor shoes inside our home. Anyhow, they are the ugliest pair of shoes I have ever owned. They also make my feet look huge and wide. But that is ok since I got them to wear inside and not many people will see me in them. However, there is another problem. In spite of the holes, they get very hot and are not breathable. If you wear them without socks, your feet will get stinky sweaty. Lastly the arch support is ok, not as good as Birkenstock. The only good thing is they are soft and cushiony which I need walking around in hard tile. But other than that, I think they are no good and don‚Äôt understand the popularity. To me they are just overpriced made in china foam shoes. Nothing great. I wish I got a pair of EVA birkenstocks to wear around the house instead. Eva Birks are not as ugly, and have better arch support and nice cushion. Also price wise I think they are about the same. My Husband got the Birkenstock‚Äôs and I like his way way better. Also birks are made in Germany (not China like crocs) and they are better quality as a result.",2, Tropical Teal,8.0,6.0,1,2019
Robert P.,Counterfeit I think,  I was so disappointed by the fit. I've owned dozens of Crocs and these dug into my feet where the circular connectors are. I'm not sure whether they're counterfeit but I'm at a Field and Stream store now trying on an authentic pair and they fit perfectly just like they always did. I should have returned them. Buyer beware at these prices.,1, Black,14.0,12.0,7,2018
zride96,Fatal Flaw - ‚ÄúMade In Mexico‚Äù - Raised Heel Strap Printing,"  I have been buying Crocs for my son since he was old enough to walk. He‚Äôs always found them comfortable and we have gone through many pairs over the years. Now we just bought a new pair and they fit great with ONE BIG EXCEPTION. They are now ‚ÄúMade in Mexico‚Äù and they used raised printed lettering on the inside of the heel strap that is very uncomfortable. When my son pointed this out and how uncomfortable it would be I thought he was kidding. Sure enough I ran my fingers over it and yeah it would be very uncomfortable. Luckily I had his previous pair and was able to remove the heel strap, without any printing, and replace it on the new pair. Most people may not have this option so I would caution against buying these as I know it would rub against the skin and be very uncomfortable. Bad decision from the manufacturer! I hope this can be corrected ASAP. They almost were returned because of one seriously fatal flaw from the manufacturer.",1, Navy,11.0,9.0,0,2020
Beckie J,bleh,"  ugh. I don't find these comfortable at all. They're a  lightweight rubbery kind of  shoe that makes my feet hot and sweaty, the inside is too bumpy and rough and my knees started aching after walking around in them for less than 15 minutes. Walking in them is not a pleasure.I suppose I will use them around water, but it's kind of disappointing because everyone seems to like them.",1, Khaki,13.0,11.0,7,2018
hdsbdjus,They run large. And contained a brown recluse spider. Thanks a lot Amazon.,"  Shoes arrived in an absolutely filthy plastic shipping bag, 6 days after ordering. The shoes were in an inner bag so I assumed they were okay, but they weren't...Didn't check the inside of the shoes before wearing - they are supposed to be new. Immediately after trying them on got a needle-like sharp pain in my toe and a black and blue swollen spot. (I didn't see the Recluse spider as they are very shy and inconspicuous and quickly disappear. (I have had these bites before and know what they are like). The pain kept coming back. Luckily I had a homeopathic salve and pills on hand. After applying the salve twice and taking the pills twice and sticking my foot in a cold compress, the pain subsided.The next day my toe is still swollen and a little sore...  Thanks for the envenomation, Amazon.Re the shoes: Love the color and ease of wearing. Love that it's waterproof. Got stuck in a rainstorm today - no problem. The only problem was the seller/packaging. I will only say this. Buy from a different vendor.",2, Tangerine,10.0,8.0,1,2020
Terranut,The size 9/11 croc made in Mexico sold in this ...,"  The size 9/11 croc made in Mexico sold in this store, is 2 sizes smaller than the size 9/11 made and sold in US.  Same product, same numbers and big difference in size!!!",1, Khaki,11.0,9.0,13,2017
Katie,These crocs are tighter and different than my many older pairs,"  The cut of these crocs is different than my older ones. It is very tight around the instep and cut is different on the heel. The material is much stiffer than my other crocs. Debating whether to order a larger size, or try to break them in. But the whole point of crocs is that they are roomy and require no break in time. What is going on with crocs now? Why are they shaped differently? I loved crocs and have a lot of foot issues so would like to find a solution.",2, Navy,8.0,6.0,3,2019

Los Angeles Dweller,Does not fit right - Too small - Not soft,"  I had to return it as it did not fit right.It doesn't have enough height for the size.  It was also a lot harder than previous Crocs I bought which were very comfortable, so even buying a bigger size would not have worked (and the bigger size would have been too long.I don't know why Crocs seem to think that people's feet have changed in th past few years...",1, Navy,13.0,11.0,5,2018
Mars Leigh,Size depends on where they‚Äôre made,"  These are my first crocs I‚Äôve ever purchased. I was looking for a comfy house shoe that I could also wear out if needed. I couldn‚Äôt decide which color I wanted so I ordered two with the plans of returning one. They‚Äôre both the same size, but they‚Äôre off from each other. One is from Mexico and the other pair are from China. The China pair (pink) are noticeably larger in width. The orange Mexico pair are more narrow and the footbed is shorter in height as well. Very strange. It‚Äôs hard because I like the orange color more, but I like how the pink ones fit. I might have to keep returning until I get the right fit. Definitely a hassle, but I know once I have the right ones it‚Äôll be worth it.",3, Cantaloupe,6.0,4.0,0,2020
Super-Elastic,"Insides are coated in glitter, stains feet","  I have previously enjoyed three pairs of Crocs and ordered two pairs this time. Both pairs arrived with tags in a sealed plastic bag. Both pairs were coated with glitter on the inside. I had to immediately wash them thoroughly lest the glitter get tracked throughout my house. Previous Crocs I've owned did not have glitter, nor have any other shoes I've ever purchased for that matter. One pair additionally had a small dirty spot. Very strange, and makes me wonder if they are fake. ""Bright cobalt"" does not look like the picture, but is instead more of a royal blue. After several weeks the blue color continues to rub off and stain socks and skin.",1, Bright Cobalt,15.0,13.0,0,2020
LeMon Tree,Not the original Crocs,"  My husband had a pair that was made in Canada.  After several years, the soles have smoothed out making them a slip hazard, so I decided it was time to purchase a new pair.  What a disappointment.  They new pair was made in Vietnam. They are not the soft squishy, great arch support Crocs that they used to make.  What a shame.  After wearing his new pair for a week, he went back to wearing his old, original Crocs.  So sad that you can't purchase the original Crocs anymore.  :(",1, Navy,12.0,10.0,1,2020
Krystal Schindler ,Very narrow!!!,"  I bought these for my daughter back at the end of May. She said they were tight but wanted to keep them. After much complaining I finally bought her a new pair, same size at a local retail store. I couldn‚Äôt believe they were the same size as the ones I bought on here. These were so narrow it was crazy. I would not buy again on here. I honestly have no idea how they were so different.",1, Black,9.0,7.0,1,2020
Prime Shopper,Not as Pictured. Quality not up to par.,"  The shoe pictured is not the shoe they sent. I sent it as a gift to my mother, and she commented on this, and the fact they don‚Äôt cushion her foot like the other pair she had before...same style shoe/same brand. The others she says she can wear all day, these she has to add an additional pair of socks or ‚Äústay on the carpet‚Äù.I suspect these may be a counterfeit product.",2, Black,8.0,6.0,1,2020
RedRoller,Terrible First Experience.,"  I have to totally agree with other reviewers.  The strap on the back forces your toes to dig into the front of the shoe and even when not using the strap, the shoes force your toenails to dig into the front of the shoe.  The bumps on the sole of the shoe are sharp and not comfortable.  I dont know what they changed since this is my first pair, but I will never buy another pair of crocs.",1, Black,12.0,10.0,4,2019
Cynthia,A little snug. Go at least one size larger.,"  These crocs were exactly what I ordered and wanted for my daughter. But when my daughter put them on she said they were a little snugger than her last crocs, (though same size) and not as sturdy or steady. Her last pair of crocs were the ones without holes around the toes.  The sole on her previous pair was a little flatter and the outside rim had a dark blue stripe around the shoe ( I think they were called crocband  clogs). This was her comparative to the new crocs. She‚Äôs still happy with new crocs since they look like the ones her friends are wearing. But i think the previous crocs fit better and were more comfortable.",3, White,8.0,6.0,1,2019
Catalina Cupcake,A very wide fit,"  I purchased these as a replacement for a pair of first generation crocs that were marked size 8-9.  I wear a size 9M American, size 42 Euro, and after reviewing the fit reviews and Croc's sizing chart, I ordered size 9.  The new size 9 crocs are much too big.  While the length was okay, the width was much too wide.  I returned the size 9s and re-ordered a pair of size 8s which are much closer in fit to my original pair but the heels are wider than the originals.  I've attached a photo of the size 9s on the left, size 8 in the middle, and the original size 8-9 on the right.  Note the width of the heels and the overall shape.  The originals fit (me) much better.  The 8s will have to do.",2, Black,11.0,9.0,6,2017
David B.,"Painful bumpy things, and a little narrow for wide feet","  Can't believe more people aren't complaining about the little bumps all over the sole of these shoes that stab me whenever I stand up, even when wearing socks. I'm a big guy, so maybe being heavier puts more pressure on my feet. But I'm probably gonna return these because I feel like I'm stepping on tiny rocks. Ok maybe not that bad, but it's not the comfort I'm looking for. Also, I have wide feet (4E) and usually buy a half size up when wides aren't available. But even a half side up, these are a little snug.On the positive side they look nice, seem to be decent quality, have good tread, breathable, everything that Crocs are known for.",3, Chocolate,14.0,12.0,0,2020
Amazon Customer,Learn from my mistake! Dont order!,"  I have ordered i think 6 pairs of these crocs. I was very happy at first. However i have noticed that they are very inconsistent in sizing. I usually wear a 6/8 but due to a navy pair i ordered bring WAY too small i decided to start sizing up to 7/9.The first 2 photos are of ""pink lemonade"" size 7/9 and the left shoe is much larger than the right.The second 2 photos are of the color ""tangerine"" size 7/9 and the right shoe id much larger.The last photo is of ""white, navy blue, and mint"" all size 6/8. I love the white and green pair however the navy blue is much smaller than the other two which is why i started ordering a size up. I wont be ordering anymore.Also the colors Navy Blue and Chocolate (not pictured) are WAY darker than i was expecting, but the preview photos are very misleading compared to the realistic shade.",1, Navy,8.0,6.0,0,2020
L. S. Brodsky,Why so popular?,"  Not sure what the big deal is with these and why they have been so popular. In an effort to fit all, they are very wide and loose. The length is the correct size and they stay on my feet, but they sure do not allow walking in any conventional sense. I am sure they will be good for campground shower facilities and kicking around a campsite or swimming pool, but they are not a replacement for sandals or water shoes.",2, Navy,9.0,7.0,1,2020
David,Really narrow.,  I own 5 pairs of original crocs in size 11 and all of them are the same and then I got these and they are super narrow.  I already took the tags off so I do not think they will take a return.  They are sold by Amazon but provided by Crocs and what is odd is Crocs are made in many different countries but these do not come from a different country than 2 others I have that are normal width.  So do not take the tags off unless you are sure and if they do not fit well the first shoe fitting they probably never will so don't try to make it work.,1, Chocolate,13.0,11.0,0,2020
Emily C,Runs large,  Bought these for my husband for Christmas 2018 as they were on sale very cheap and he has always wanted a pair of Crocs. I've never heard that their sizes were not true to size but my husband has small feet at a size 7 in mens and the 7 in means I ordered him were too large. He can wear them but he has to move the strap behind his foot to ensure they stay on.,3, Chocolate,9.0,7.0,3,2019
Andy G,Possibly the most uncomfortable and ugly footwear ever,"  I bought these Crocs to wear at the beach. The little dimples inside the shoe annoy me. Uncomfortable. Also, by virtue of being open, your feet get filthy. Worse than with sandals or flip flops.I knew up front that one looks like a doofus wearing rubber clogs, but hoped they would work out better and last longer than the water walkers I usually wear. Those tend to last only one or two seasons.I wore them for a couple of weeks hoping they would grow on me. No such luck. I cleaned them and donated to Goodwill. Maybe someone else will enjoy these Crocs.",2, Army Green,11.0,9.0,0,2020
Go Hornets!!!!,"Great shoes, but man they are really ugly.",  I never have liked the looks of these butt ugly things but my podiatrist told me to get a pair because of a foot problem.  They do offer great support and curiousness for my poor broken foot.  I find that when I walk my heel tends to extend over the inner sides and wants to roll in.  This is because I have such a high instep that my foot does not go all the way in.  I have about an inch of room in front of my big toe and my heel actually sticks out the back a little.  Perhaps I should have gone with a larger size?  The construction of these shoes is great and they are comfortable.  I expect that I will continue to wear these around the house once my foot has healed because of the support they offer.  I like them as slippers but not for walking any distance.,3, Black,13.0,11.0,3,2017
H.D.,What happened to Crocs Classic,  The 2020 version of the classic Croc's is a size smaller than the old ones and at least a size narrower. Plus the material is stiff with little cushion. 15 years ago when I bought my last pair of the classics they fix me well because they were over sized in all directions plus had a cushioned ride that lasted for many years. I can't buy these any more in this new small size. I do have a recent Croc work shoes that seems to have the old dimensions as well a Garden shoes that fit fine. I bought a 12 when I used to wear an 11 and its fits tighter. I have toe and foot problems so I can not recommend these.,2, Pepper,14.0,12.0,0,2020
chavala,Check the size before too late to return!,"  I've been wearing Crocs as garden clogs for years (never in public!).I decided to order 1 size up so I can wear with thicker socks in winter --  but they were enormous!  WAY bigger than my old pair.OK, so I ordered my normal size 6 Men/8 Women.  The left shoe was super tight and I couldn't even get my foot in the right.  When I held them up next to each other and the right shoe as an entire inch shorter than it's mate!  They were both marked 6/8 on the bottom -- Made in China.I give up. I guess I have to go into a store and try them on to know what size I'm really getting.",1, Slate Grey,8.0,6.0,0,2020
Mike Nasser,Got a defective one!,"  You expect good quality control from a brand name like Crocs so it‚Äôs disappointing to get one with obvious defects. The strap on the left slipper is bent out of round, so it‚Äôs not comfortable to wear. I tried stretching it over the back of the slipper overnight to get it back in shape, but it didn‚Äôt help. It seems something went wrong in the molding process. I bought this on sale on Black Friday so maybe they were unloading second quality items during this sale, or I just got a bad one. The question is whether I want to go through the hassle of shipping this back to exchange it on Amazon!  It‚Äôs a disappointing to have to go through this on a simple order.",2, Navy,12.0,10.0,1,2018
Tripping Wisteria,Not like my old Crocs,"  I bought my first pair of Crocs almost ten years ago, back when they were made in Colorado.  They were the most comfortable shoe for hanging around the house or cooking in the kitchen for long periods of time.  My house has tile or hardwood so there isn't a lot of give there.  Those Crocs were made out of a softer, squishier rubber that had a lot of give to it.  These Crocs are made of a firmer material that seems like it has some plastic in it.  They aren't very cushioned.  They are also a lot smaller.  They fit but just barely.  Don't know if that's because I got a pair from Mexico instead of China (and how weird is it to be hoping you get one of the ones from China but all the reviews agree they fit better than the ones from Mexico.)  Also these have anti-fatigue nubs inside.  They are arranged in ridges, higher in some parts than others.  You can see it's meant to be higher above the ball of your foot, under your toes but the weird sizing keeps my foot from fitting perfectly in that area so mostly I'm just walking on uneven nubs.  I don't know if they work for anti-fatigue because they hurt my feet and I can only wear these shoes for about an hour at a time.  I suppose it will be like when I was a kid in the summer and at first it hurt to go barefoot outside but after a while your feet toughen up and it stops hurting.  Not thrilled though to have paid money for shoes that my feet have to toughen up for.  They are also a lot hotter to wear than my old Crocs.  Not sure if it's because of the smaller size or the new material.  Overall, I'm very unhappy with these shoes.  Looks like I'll have to find a replacement for my old Crocs elsewhere.",2, Khaki,8.0,6.0,3,2015
LaTrice Polk,Wrong size.  Size misprint.  DO NOT BUY FROM THIS SELLER,  I wear a size 10.  I purchased 4 pair of Crocs and the red pair is smaller than the other 3.  I've had the red pair for over 1 month and decided to wear them to work today.  I immediately noticed that they felt short but I went to work anyway.  When I returned home I compared them to my other Crocs and discovered they are a size too small.  It says  size 10 on the bottom but its obviously a misprint.  I took a picture to show the difference.  The purple ones were made in China and the red ill-fitting ones were made in Bosnia.  I will never order from this seller again.  Now I'm questioning if the red ones are authentic Crocs or a knockoff.,1, Pepper,10.0,8.0,0,2020
MamaJean,I ordered these to replace my original rubbery Crocs but these are way too hard I had to return them,  I'm sorry but these are not the Crocs that I am used to. They are made out of hard plastic and the bumps on the inside of the sole actually hurt the soles of my feet I am flat-footed and Crocs were the best when they were made out of rubber but these are not rubber at all these are not cushy at all so I had to return them I replaced my order with a better product which is cushy soft rubber. Amoji brand. They are made of soft rubber and they are half the price of the Crocs so that's a win-win for me,3, Khaki,10.0,8.0,0,2020
Mike Pardo,Disappointed In Replacement Classic Crocs,"  Ordered a pair of Crocs to replace my 5 year plus old crocs that I really enjoyed wearing while doing my yard work.  These new crocs look and feel like they used a completely new type of material and the sole feels like it is now made with hole areas (web) in the middle, and give you a mushy feel with little support to the bottom of your feet.  Not worth the $50 bucks I paid for them.  When I chose the Classic Crocs, that's what I expected - same look, feel, material and solid construction that I enjoyed in the last pair I purchased.",1, Black,13.0,11.0,3,2019
UNION INSURANCE AGENCY,Fake ‚Äúcrocs‚Äù,"  Very upset. I purchased some Crocs (or so I thought) on here for my nephew before Christmas, and gave them to him already. My daughter ordered from the same place and noticed that they were a bit off and when we compared them to Crocs bought on the actual website, we realized the ones purchased from here are FAKE. You might see the picture listed twice because my daughter posted a review on the ones she bought as well but both were made in different countries. My daughter is returning hers but I sadly cannot because my nephew has already worn them. Very disappointed because these should not be listed as Crocs because they aren‚Äôt.

Otherwise the company won't cover the defect.,1, Navy,13.0,11.0,3,2019
katie d.,"They Work for What I Need, But They Seem Highly Overrated","  I bought these specifically for my rowing club needs. I needed something waterproof, easy to get on & off quickly, and the ability to stuff my foot into while wearing bulky wool socks (and, as I encountered the other day, the ability to actually float). They do provide for all of these needs. The fit, however, is a little weird. I'm a pretty solid Women's 7, with a fairly wide foot. The width is fine, but my toes hit the end of the shoe pretty aggressively without socks, and the toe grip thingy on the sole seems oddly placed.That said, I can see why some people think they're comfortable. But here are my top cons:They are terrible for gardening. If I'm walking on wet grass in the morning, my feet get wet. If I'm doing even light weeding, I get dirt stuck everywhere between the shoes and my feet.They are plastic and no matter how many holes you put in them, my feet sweat like crazy.They seem kind of expensive for plastic shoes.I think I'm going to stick to my FitFlops for life outside of rowing a boat. They have way better arch support, and they aren't quite as ugly.",3, Black,7.0,5.0,5,2015
MplsMary,Narrower and no arch support.,"  These are different from the classic Crocs of yore. I'm bummed out, but I'll just use these until I find a new go-to comfort shoe. Probably go back to running shoes for casual comfort.Not only are they much narrower, but the arch support is gone and they've changed the sole from a slight heel to flat, exacerbating the lack of arch support.It seems insane that they'd change the design and not alert their loyal customer base. I guess they wanted us all to buy one more pair before we switch our loyalties.",1, Black,10.0,8.0,7,2016

They're the same size as the other two sets I have, but they're too small. I wear 8 wide, and the size 8 in the past has been perfect. Not this time.

Although for some reason, the black pair feels completely different. The sole for the black pair is extremely abrasive and bumpy to the point where it feels sharp. I was upset and also skeptical because I bought both of them from the same exact page. I don't know if crocs are meant to vary like that?

Nick,"Issue with Amazon, moreso than the product","  The Crocs are shipped by Amazon in a bag. Because of this, anything on top of them are going to compress the shape. Clearly mine had been squished for quite some time, as the shape of the shoe opening is drastically creased. Stupidly, I figured this would reform over time... Instead I get blisters every time I wear them, so they're going to be donated. I'm a big fan of Crocs (mostly for the sex appeal), but I would never get them through Amazon again.IMPORTANT ALSO - The actual material itself feels much cheaper than the other crocs I own and purchased direct.

Tinker,IT IS NOT WIDE ENOUGH,"  In the ""how does this product fit?"" drop-down list, ""too narrow"" and ""not wide enough"" are not choices. CROCS come in MEDIUM. No AA, B, C, D, DD etc.I realize it is not a serious shoe like a Florsheim, a Rockport or a New Balance. But how about an a B, C and D at least.I loved CROCS till I got these. I have 2 pair that are at least five years old and half hundreds of thousands of miles on them---no tread so they are scary on wet roads, but still serviceable. Both pair are substantially wider than the new ones so I know CROCS weren't always just Medium. Just like I know that people are not all Medium. And that's really the issue in making a product.The CROC website says there are different widths: ""Roomy"", ""Relaxed"", and ""Standard."" You just can't get them. Amazon and Zappos and all other outlets have Medium. Which is a ""CROC.""",1, Black,13.0,6.0,4,2014
georgie7675,Hopefully the 3rd time's the charm......,"  This was my second attempt at getting a new pair of Crocs that fit. My shoe size is W6.5 so I bought the size W6 Crocs. When they arrived and I tried them on, they were too small. My toes were scrunched together and walking just a few steps was not comfortable at all. I returned them and ordered the next size up (W7), but they were still too small. I compared them next to the pair I currently have (size W6-7/S/M4-5, bought from a shop in Mexico) and you can immediately see the size difference (see attached photo). Haven't decided yet whether to go up the next 2 sizes or just go up 1 size at a time. I am able to return them for a full refund, so that's good. But seeing how much smaller they are, I might jump up to size 9 even though my shoe size has never been that big. If those fit me well, then I will change my rating to 5 stars, as I love my Crocs and wanted to replace them with ones I could wear outside (wore a hole through them that they are now inside shoes/slippers).",2, Black,7.0,5.0,23,2015
Randy P.,Wrong sized shoes a waste of my money,"  I have worn crocs for years, never a problem. I ordered these and they came in and had the right size stamped on them so I tossed them into the closet since my old crocs were still hanging in there. Pulled them out yesterday and both shoes are too small despite the correct size (13) stamped on the bottom.  The left shoe is even smaller than the right one.  What a waste of time and money. I should have tried them on back then but with the correct size stamped on them it did not even occur to me. I have long ago tossed out the box. A waste of time and money. If you buy from this place then make sure you test out everything. Crocs are a very loose fitting casual shoe and I have never had one not fit. But live and learn. Use care with this provider, perhaps a problem with quality control.",1, Black,13.0,6.0,0,2018
Janee Jarrell,Uggg.,"  Uggg. I wore these for 3 hours gardening and they are going back. My feet are killing me. It was those little bumps on the footbed that did me in. Two hours later and my feet are still complaining. Then, I began my research. Yes, ER docs and operating room people love them. What other shoes can you hose off? Podiatrists, however, hate them and don't recommend then for more than a few hours. There are two exceptions -- those with super high arches and those with lots of swelling in their feet.",1, Pepper,8.0,6.0,0,2019

Jonathan A. Villalta,Quality has changed. They shrink,  Waste of money. The quality has changed not for the better. I had purchased crocs a few years ago for myself and kids and they were great didn‚Äôt have any issues. Just recently the kids outgrown them so I decided to purchase new ones for our camping trip. So a week after we received them we take them with us and when we went to bed we left them outside the tent. The next morning the crocs shrunk about 3 sizes down. It was horrible we were left without shoes. Don‚Äôt know what happened because with our old crocs we left them outside in 120 degree weather and nothing ever happened. Such a waste of money and now we need to purchase new sandals again.,1, Black,8.0,6.0,0,2020
cynthia fields,Not what expected!,"  My husband wears Crocs all the time and has several styles, including multiple pairs that look like these. However, this gift to replace a worn out pair are awful! They have nubs inside the shoe that poke the foot when wearing with and without socks. They are not wearable. They feel like you are walking on a nail bed.  I couldn't imagine needing to return,  and bought them early for a birthday gift. Now we have past the return date and have a useless pair of shoes. I am also left feeling insecure about ordering others. Need help to exchange, but can't find that either.",1, Slate Grey,12.0,10.0,1,2020

CW,lighter shade of green than expected,"  I made this a 3 just on color... the quality of the Crocs themselves are a 5 as always, I've been wearing them for years. I'm just giving it a 3 in case it helps anyone else w/ color choice. I guess I remember Army green being a little darker (from having actually been in the Army)it's on the beige / sandier sider of green than the darker OD green i was thinking.

M. George,Lovely Color but Too Wide,"  The baby blue color was pretty. I bought it in size 9B (W)/ 7 B(M). My daughter wears a size 7.5-8.0, and I am a size 8.5-9.0. The shoe was too long by a thumb and a quarter length for me and even longer for my daughter. I based the purchase on an older croc that was labeled 8-9 and which fit her just fine but touched my toe. I tend to like to purchase a half size up, so I ordered the 9. Because the length was too long, the ankle strap was useless. The width was too wide for my medium width feet and extra wide for my daughter's narrow feet. If you are a size 8.5-9.0 like me, I'd order a size 8. But beware that the width will still be big in general and especially for folks with narrow feet. The little nubs in the shoe were more pronounced in the toe area and hardly felt in the other areas of the shoe. I have flat feet, and the shoe did not have any arch support which works fine for me since my feet tend to hurt when shoes have significant arch support.",3, Pool,9.0,7.0,0,2016

Amazon Customer,Hard as a rock with a much thinner heel than it looks,"  I needed a pair of house shoes with good support since I recently was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis. I had a pair of knock-off crocs that I bought at a flea market for years that I absolutely loved but ended up wearing them through. I thought I'd just go with the real Crocs this time since the others didn't seem to have a brand on them. These are so disappointing compared to them! The knock-offs had a firm, yet cushioning sole that was a good height off the ground. These basically feel like I'm standing barefoot on a hard wood floor! The heel is much thinner than it looked because the heel dips down on the inside. I will not be purchasing another pair of crocs again.",1, Navy,9.0,7.0,0,2019
Debbie L,The fit has changed.,"  I purchased a Womens 7 in the Crocs Classic Clog, the size I have worn for years. Earlier this year I had purchased a leopard print Croc in a Womens 7 which was small.  I just assumed the Classic would fit as it always had. I liked to wear Crocs in the house or to go out with the dogs in the backyard, as they were easy to slip into. I'm disappointed that they don't fit like they used to. (My old pair, a Women's 7, that I have to throw out was much more comfortable.)  The way the straps are attached, they don't go all the way to the back of the shoe, so you are losing almost 3/4 of an inch.  If you use them like a clog, they fit okay.  I guess I would have to buy an 8, to wear the strap in the back, but I think it would be too big otherwise.",2, Bright Cobalt,7.0,5.0,0,2020
JeanieSean,I question whether these are true Crocs.,"  I use an insert for Plantar fasciitis and fallen arches. These ""crocs"" are more shallow in the foot area than the real crocs, and the insert wants to walk itself out of the back of the heel due to the shallow depth. I question whether these are genuine crocs as they are certainly different. I had to give mine to my granddaughter. The size is slightly smaller, as well as the shallowness of the food area.",1, Garnet,8.0,6.0,0,2020

The Classic Clog in size 8 is huge -- feels like a 9 or even a 10. Since I'm normally an 8.5 Wide, it makes no sense to me that a size 8 would be so large.

Cadence,Different than my previous pairs,"  I recently bought a pair of white Crocs from a Crocs outlet and I find them really comfortable. I decided I wanted a second and so I bought a pair from here.When They came I immediately noticed the holes were in different places (not a big deal), but once I put them on I realized not only were the holes in different places, the foam was a lot less responsive and overall uncomfortable.After inspecting the sole of the Croc I saw that this pair was manufactured in Vietnam while my first pair that I bought in the actual store was made in China.Ultimately, they look pretty similar and I'm wearing them as slides around the house anyway.

The material is NOT the cushy comfortable foam that I had hoped for - it is much less rubber-y and much more plastic-y than the old ones and the sizing is also way off.  In comparing the two, the new ones are about a half inch shorter in total length than my old ones of the same size.

Now they are trying to base it on the shoe size.  I wear a 10.5 normally.  When I ordered the 11, they were 1-1.5 inches too long.  I had to send those back to get the 10.  Now these are a little short and rub against my heel.  I'm so bummed that I can't find the size I had before since I wore those so much I literally wore holes in the bottoms and had to replace them.  The good news is that they are wide enough for my foot.

They hem-haw about the size and then I was told that they did not come in black. He did tried and give me another type of croc that was suppose to be in women's black size 7. That also was a joke because there was no such number. This is the first time I have had this type of problem with Amazon and I hope that I never do again.

Amazon_Customer,Mysterious shrinking clogs,"  Not sure what exactly happened, but I'll try to describe it. Sorry if it would sound weird :)So, first of all ‚àí I ordered Khaki, but received Black color. I actually didn't mind, because black was very good-looking, not dark-grayish, but really black, so I liked it.As for the size, here's where weirdness starts. I initially was happy with the size, it was even a tiny little bit larger than I wanted, but it's good with this type of footwear. Later I felt like it became fit exactly right, so I figured I just ""got used to it"". Then, after some time (I was happily wearing them for couple weeks, and really enjoyed them), I once found that I literally can't put them on: they are too small. I thought they just deformed a bit because of whatever -- salty ocean water, sun etc., and that they'll get back to normal soon. My wife half-jokingly said that my feet swelled :)Anyway, I tried to wear them for a minute, and it really hurt (I know, I shouldn't have, that was stupid, why would they become large again :)).Anyway, now they are even smaller, I can't even pretend I can put them on. I swear all my other shoes are fine, so my feet didn't swell :)I don't know if this all makes any sense, so I'm putting three stars as a neutral rating.",3, Khaki,12.0,10.0,0,2014

Welton E. Underwood,"The bottoms were very smooth and comfortable, but for some reason one of the straps ...","  I have a pair of Crocs I bought at Dicks and wore them to and around Maui, Hawaii.  The bottoms were very smooth and comfortable, but for some reason one of the straps tore and came off so I ordered the pair I'm now wearing from Amazon and they are extremely uncomfortable with nibs so long on the insoles that they hurt and make my feet ache.  Being a diabetic I can't risk the crocs causing problem.  I wondered about the crocs so I took them to an actual croc store in Myrtle Beach and the sales lady assured me they were authentic saying that it depends on what country the crocs are made in as to how the nibs are on the insoles.  She suggested sanding off the nibs with sandpaper saying that is what her Dad did,  The Croc employee was so nice, helpful, and sweet especially when I fell in the store.  She only had one problem:  her name wasn't Amazon.  I wish I had sent the shoes back but for a swap-out but I didn't.  I hoped the nibs would wear down.  They haven't.  In researching this particular order, I discovered the straps on the new crocs are removable, so I am going to look at removing them and placing them on my original pair of crocs.  Croc Corporate is trying to help me and they have been extremely nice just like the Amazon employees with whom I have dealt.  I  guess I am just a balding, fat, Southern old coot who is too set in his ways about what he likes or doesn't.  I look at my wife of 35 years and then at Amazon.  If I was told I had to make a choice between the two, well I just I hope Amazon will be real understanding when I park my motorhome in their parking lot.  Love the place.",1, Black,14.0,12.0,4,2018

I wear size 7 1/2, but decided I wanted them a little roomy, so I went with size 8-9 and was surprised that my feet barely fit in them.

Not so much that it's a problem, and they do give more with time, but it's noticeable. At least to me. I'd probably give this more like 3.5/5 than a 3.

Public buyer.,or it would be best if the buyer of the product can choose the ...,"  It seems that the size and toe space is different depending on where the Crocs were produced. The ones from Mexico seem to run smaller with a narrower toe space than the ones from China. This makes it difficult to order because it is not clear as to where the product being sent to me is from, Why should there be a difference in size for the ""same"" shoe? Are the templates used different in different countries. It may need to be stated in the order guide where the product being sent is from, or it would be best if the buyer of the product can choose the manufacturer of the Croc. All of this is moot if there is still a difference in fit between the same products from the same country much less from Mexico vs China. That's why it is so confusing when I read the critiques of the product where some one would say the size is 1/2 to 1 size larger than stated and someone else says it is 1 to 1/2 size too small. The comparison must also state whether they were discussing a Croc produced in China vs Mexico or where ever.",2, Navy,9.0,7.0,0,2014

Sharon M.,Beware of ladies' vs. Unisex sizing!,"  Based on a previously purchased pair similar (but without backstrap) that were a bit snug at the end of the day or on ""swollen feet"" days, I purchased this, only one size larger. Mistake.  I am SWIMMING in these. I might try them in the fall with socks, but that defeats the purpose of easy rinse off with hose through the holes.  Moreover, since most gardening is done with water, I'll be left with wet, dirty socks each time.  Beware of the difference between ladies', men's, and unisex products.  My former purchase must have been a ladies' shoe (didn't buy online, and there's no indication inside or underneath shoe, just a size number), and these are unisex.  Bottomline, if basing new purchase size on a current pair of shoes, know that unisex is like TWO sizes larger than a current ladies' size.  It would be nice, also, if Crocs would 1.) consider labeling the bottom of their shoes with an L, U, or MN (not just M, or people might think ""medium"" who didn't know better) before the size number (for ladies, uni, or men) so that  future customers (and current! esp. if received as a gift) know what they own, and equally important, 2.) state how to convert various gender sizing with ordering similar or same shoes--example ""Order same size if you want a slightly larger fit, when going from ladies' to unisex.""",2, Navy,9.0,7.0,9,2016

His are comfortable and made in china. Many reviews said the mexican manufactured croc offered less cush, uneven heel straps, and pretend nubs on the footbed. Reviews compared this shoe to the chinese manufactured croc, which was more cushion-y, had even heel straps, and nice nubs on the footbed.Amazon claimed their crocs were Origin: China ( I cut and pasted the last two words from the description of the product in ""my orders"" section of their website.) I was disappointed when the crocs arrived. The heel straps were even with each other, but at least a half inch shorter than the shoe. The aren't cushion-y at all. The footbed nubs are more like a design. They aren't comfortable, at all, and the heel strap is unusable because it makes the shoe much too small.I wouldn't have bought the shoe knowing it would be from mexico, given the reviews. Apparently they have free returns on some products but it is hard to find if this shoe is one of them. If its not the return cost is half the price of the shoe, so I'm stuck with a mislabeled inferior product.And they aren't even comfortable! So what's the point?In addition, there was trouble with the shipping of this product and two others I ordered at the same time. I've been wasting my time on the phone with generally unhelpful amazon reps for the last three days. The man I spoke with today was extremely helpful, and when I mentioned this to him, he said on the fourth call Amazon directs the caller to a Senior Agent, (aka someone who is helpful) but the calls prior will be directed to someone who is not a senior agent (aka someone who is not helpful). I am always curious to know the whereabouts of the call center, and I feel intrusive asking, but I did ask this time, and the man was in Costa Rica. I'm pretty sure the guy I spoke with yesterday was in India, and I would love to know how many american cents amazon pays him a week. He could be helpful, but he has a lot of ""Amazon policies"" to stick to which prevented us from getting anywhere.Amazon has lost my favor. We had a good run, though.",1, Navy,10.0,8.0,9,2014
David H. Webster,Awesome camp shoes!,"  I absolutely love the weight/comfort ratio of these shoes!  They're the perfect backpacking shoe to wear around camp and even cross a stream if you need to keep your boots dry.  They weigh nothing but feel wonderful when the boots that have been stuck to your foot for 15mi and 5,000' feel like a million pounds at the end of the day.My only reason for rating this product lower than 5-stars is price.  These have become so popular that they're way more expensive than they used to be.  I can only assume that someone is grinning all the way to the bank on the margins.  I'm certain I've become all too accustomed to cheap products manufactured overseas, but $48 MSRP is lunacy!",3, Chocolate,11.0,9.0,0,2014

Because I'd thrown away the wrapping, I won't return them, and I might order a smaller size, just to see.

I know that I can send this back and ask for refund/replacement. But the thing is, my gramps didn't want to do it because it'll take time for us to get the item again.

I have several pairs of Crocs Classics in size 11W/9M which fit fine.  I recently ordered two additional pairs in the same size, and they are markedly smaller - close to a full size smaller - though they are marked as 11W/9M.  All pairs were made in Mexico, so it is not like different molds in different countries.  There is simply no consistency, and my tendency now would be to NOT buy Crocs online from Amazon or any other retailer but to buy them in a store where I can try them on before buying.

However, I found out that if you leave them out in the sun (on a deck, for example), they *shrink*! I can't wear the pair I bought in December, as they no longer fit on my feet. I bought another pair earlier, and loved them. The tread on the bottom had worn down after a couple of years of hard use, so I replaced them with the exact same item.

However, it is very overshadowed by the senesation of countless raised bumps digging into the sole of my foot whenever I walk.

Firefly,Great shoes...when you get the fit that you ordered!,"  I was disappointed in the fit. actually too wide and a little short. I ordered my usual shoe size. Out of three different Croc shoes that I have purchased recently, this was the worst fit. It would help a lot if when ordering, there was more to go on to select a proper fit. Then there is the chance that you did not get the same manufactured shoe as was described. From reading other comments, I feel that my experience in buying  Croc shoe is very similar. Thus my three stars. I love a Croc, when it fits as described. I feel that I will no longer participate in this Croc hunting game in the future.

Casey Y.,The Mysterious Sizing of Crocs,"  Purchased the silver Croc and fell in love with them (did not see that coming!).  Sprained my ankle pretty badly a few days later and fortunately had these which were the only shoe I could wear with all the tape and the ankle brace. (Felt fairly stable, too!) Decided to buy some more, so got the khaki. Weirdly tho, the khaki are the same size (per the chart, 10""=9 women)...BUT, the size label on the new package had ""roomy"" on the size label and the Croc is way larger than the same-sized silver purchased before and had fit just dandy. As I pointed out to Amazon, the ""roomy"" designation's explanation was nowhere to be found in the description on the web page. Of course (and I may yet do exactly this), I can keep ordering them and hoping I will get a non-""roomy"" shoe.  But, it does seem a whole lot messier (more work and time) than the seller being clear about the sizes or at least noting that some of the sizes come ""roomy"".  Why was there no description on ANY of the Croc shoes I looked at (studied the size chart on every Croc I looked at, so that wasn't the problem) delineating the ""roomy"" sizing.  It just seems to be common sense.  I know nothing else sized this way and am glad for that.  Imagine a dress or pants that come in a size 9 and a size 9 roomy, but you can't know by the description...  I mean, even then there's designations like ""relaxed fit"" so you are aware of the difference.",2, Pepper,9.0,7.0,5,2016

Perhaps THAT explains the lacking quality difference?  Again it still works fine, but SORRY!  I'm not paying $30 for crocs MADE IN CHINA that look like the cheaper chinese-made knock-offs!  For those, the only things lacking are the cute little croc buttons on the sides.  I'll buy other brands (albeit made in china) for a lot less.",3, Khaki,11.0,9.0,0,2009

Kaos HQ,Size 14 is not correct in size/ more like a size 16 or bigger,"  Too bad this Croc is sized incorrectly.  I usually wear a size 14 shoe.  While at a local Big 5 I tryed on a size 13 and found that it was too small.  (It was worth a try)  I was excited to find this size 14 on Amazon.  Upon receiving the Crocs I found that they were marked as 14, but were several sizes too big.  I could have left my shoes on and put them inside the Croc.  When I used the printed the return label through Amazon I found that I had to pay the shipping to return them.  I contacted the seller, Surf and Dirt.com, and talked to a helpful customer service rep.  He told me that I would have to ship the item back at my cost and then after examination they would make a determination of whether they would pay shipping.To follow up:  I returned the sandals which were inspected by Surf and Dirt and my money was promptly refunded for the item and delivery.

Greg Hill,No two are ever the same size or shape. EVER.,"  Having purchased four pairs, as well as trying on a few different styles at the local Croc's store, it's become painfully clear that the physical size and shape of Croc's clogs varies wildly from shoe to shoe even within the same style (even within the same pair!).

The size W9/M7 is identical to W8/M6, both made in Mexico, with the strap being shorter than before. Inconsistent sizing makes it virtually impossible to buy online. This model is called Classic and is supposed to substitute for Cayman, but the sizing is all wrong. The ones made in China seem to run larger, but you do not know the origin of the pair that will be shipped.The actual Crocs store might be currently the best option for proper sizing, unfortunately.

They are great for that purpose - when you get ready to go back in the house you can simply hose them off. My old Crocs had worn down to the point where they were so smooth they could be slippery on a concrete floor, so I decided to order these . Since I loved the old ones, I tried to get the exact same shoes. My old ones were made in Mexico so I ordered the ones that were also made in Mexico in the same size.

Andrew,"Satisfied, not ecstatic, but I'll continue to buy/wear out of loyalty.","  I started wearing Crocs when I began college in Boulder, CO, which is the birthplace of Crocs.  I'll continue to wear Crocs out of loyalty, but I'm not  ecstatic about these ""classic"" Crocs.  I put classic in quotation marks, because Crocs loyalists know that they were once made in the USA, and the shoes that were made in the USA were sized in ranges and were made of superior material that was a tad bit softer.  Please know that I'm traditionally not a hooah-hooah ""Made in the USA"" minion, but there are distinct differences between the USA- and Mexican-made Crocs.  Crocs made in Mexico are made of a similar (but different) material that has a slippery finish, and they are sized in whole-sizes only.  I resisted buying Mexican Crocs because of these material and fit factors, and so I wore down my USA Crocs to the end.I wear a 10.5 running show, and in the USA size Crocs I wore men's XL (10-11), which were perfect!  For the Mexican Crocs I ordered M11, but they were too large: too much play in the toes and too much length between the heel of the shoe and the heel of the foot.  I returned them for Mexican M10, which is what I settled on.  They're good with room in the toe, but I would have liked an extra half-inch on the heel.  This is why the USA sizing scheme was better FOR ME.  I acknowledge all feet are different.Some will say that the changes in workmanship came after the supposed slit of the company's founders due to a nasty divorce.  Search for that on the internet and decide for yourself.Props to Amazon for the consistent Prime service, and this was the first purchased I used the Amazon Locker feature, and that went well.

That was a deal breaker for me (thankfully Amazon has a free return option!)Also - they felt somewhat large lengthwise (I'm normally 12 / 12.5 so I figured 12 would be on a smaller size but that was not the case).Finally - I didn't like the overall loose fit (I guess some would call it ""comfortable"" but I wouldn't dare to step outside in them; definitely couldn't run in them or even walk fast).Note for reference - I'm not a sandal / flip-flop, etc. person - I always wear regular, closed, well-fitting shoes.",2, Black,14.0,12.0,0,2013
Boston Audiophile,"Great for the yard, But do not leave out in the sun...","  These are what you expect; waterproof, easy to clean and pretty darn comfortable. Great for yard work, gardening and for slipping on and off when you need quick foot ware. In other words, shoes when you're too lazy to put on regular shoes. Better than flip flops when you need some tootsie protection.My only complaint is if you leave these in the sun they will shrink considerably. I left mine on the back stoop where they get direct sun in the afternoon. The rubber shrank a full size smaller so they no longer fit. I live in Massachusetts where the sun isn't intense. But apparently afternoon UV exposure is enough to cook your Crocs. I have never seen this happen with flip flops that I have left outside. It's disappointing Crocs wouldn't have this figured out (i.e. UV resistant rubber, etc.) especially given their practical use in the yard.",3, Black,11.0,9.0,14,2017

One shoe felt somewhat small, while the other was impossible to wear, because the strap was too short to stay behind my heel. Like other reviewers, I noticed these were made in Mexico rather than in China. I'm a loyal Amazon shopper and am hoping Amazon will take care of this, because either Crocs has a problem with their merchandise quality online - or these were knockoffs!

I could not have been mistaken because the size was still visible imprinted on the bottom of the old shoes.

Abbott,Cute shoes.  But too small or too large if you're a true half size!,"  I bought a size 9 (women) since I wear a 9 in a sandal.  I wear a 9.5 in a closed toe shoe.  But there was a recommendation in this description that half sizes should order down.  So I thought a size 9 would be just right for me.  Alas, they are too short.  The end of my toes touches the front of the shoe even without a sock.  So I immediately had to put them back in the box and return them.  According to my experience, one would order a size up, not a size down.  A 9 is too short for a 9.5 foot.  Still, they are very nice and attractive shoes, so I'm ordering a size 10.  I'm giving 5 stars because there was nothing wrong with the shoes, just bought the wrong size and don't think the description should have suggested ordering a size down.Update:  I have to change my rating from a 5 star to a 2 star for the simple reason that they will not work for someone like me with exactly 1/2 size off.  After the above-described experience (ordering a size 9 women for my 9.5 foot), I sent them back and ordered a size 10 women.  They are enormous.  I can't possibly wear them even with a very thick sock.  They fit me like boats.  I really wanted to like these, and except for their being a smidgeon too small in size 9, I really would have liked them.  I guess I have to give up on Crocs.  I would guess there are a lot of people like me in between sizes who can't make them work.  Much of the problem might be that when the size gets larger, both the length and the width increase.  I didn't need them any wider at all, just a tiny bit longer.  Too bad.",2, Black,9.0,7.0,2,2016

William Campbell III,I am extremely disappointed in the sizing of these Unisex Classic Crocs,"  I am extremely disappointed in the sizing of these Unisex Classic Crocs.  There is a severe size distortion between the M7 and M8 sizes; the former is far too short and the latter is far too long for my foot.

I have hard wood floors and am super pregnant, so every step was beginning to really hurt.  I've heard good things about these, so I bought the cheapest color in size huge because my feet are in fact, huge.  They fit fine and have definitely eliminated a lot of my foot pain, however, my feet are sitting in a sauna.  I have to wear socks with them and I still have super sweaty (and not to mention, stinky) feet. I'm not one to have ever had a sweaty or stinky foot issue, but in these I'm queen gross foot.  I knew this would be an issue to an extent, but wow, this is ridiculous.  I'll switch between these and my gel flip flops (which don't do much for me) throughout the day, just to give my feet a breather.  Are they comfortable?  Yes.

Ok, maybe I just bought some from a bad batch, so I got on Amazon & bought another pair (a size too big in case they shrunk a little & white to lessen the heating).

Ravenhill,Sorry system for sizing on this description,"  If sizing on the order screen and description matched exactly what is on the shoes, it would help. I love the shoe, and the low stars are about ordering from this Amazon seller.The shoe itself reads M5 W7 has a tag that says ""M5/W7"" and is clearly labeled Made in Mexico. I'm returning them for another size up, hoping I don't get US sized ones which will then be too big.I've worn Crocs for years, and the way sizes were listed on this item description was confusing, as it did not match the ones I was wearing when I tried to place the order - which were made in the US - read ""W 8-9 M 6-7"". These were not an option. As a result, after measuring my foot, using the chart Crocs provides, etc etc I have a pair that is too small. I put a lot of thought into it and did not just push a random button.Ideally, the top and sides should not touch your foot when you are standing. They are supposed to fit that way....and so if you find them hot, it may be you are not in a large enough size.Annoyed that I now have a wait for the right shoe. Wish the brand would standardize the way shoes are labeled and that people selling it would then follow that method...and not lie about where the shoes are made, as in putting US in the title.",1, Navy,8.0,6.0,55,2013

And that's true of this one, the Classic clog, so order down a half-size if your normal size happens to be one that Crocs doesn't make.It's important 'NOT' to overestimate which size you'll need is because the strap at the back will fall down if they're too large, causing your shoes to fall off, thus being essentially unwearable.LATE EDIT: After a month of wear, I decided to revisit my review. Part of my reason for reexamining my initial review is a change I've noticed is the rubberiness or softness of the material now used in my Crocs clogs. Besides their (apparent) tendency to wear out quicker, I now have problems with stability in them, which is a very important issue for me because of health issues.In all fairness, I have other Crocs, some sandals, which aren't composed of such soft material, but I'm not trying to analyze the decision-making process that led to the change. However the change came about, the newer clogs are now made of a poorer quality material. Moreover, the issue of stability is something I've monitored because of its importance to me. I've been chastened in my past experiences with Croc imitators, only to go back to Crocs once again. And now I find myself having to look elsewhere once more.",3, Navy,12.0,10.0,15,2016

The old ones was made in China and the rubber is a lot different than the new crocs that are made now in Mexico. If you leave these crocs in the sun they will shrink a size down. My old crocs I store them on my back porch and they get full sun and have never shrunk. I left these new ones from Mexico in the sun for only a few hours and they are at lease 1/2 size smaller now. My big toe hits the end now as before it didn't. My husband bought a new pair last year and told me they are a lot different than our old pairs and he swore they shrunk when he left them outside but I didn't listen and when I got my new pair it did the same thing. The rubber on the Mexico one's is like a shiny rubber as the old one's from China is a dull rubber. The China ones seems a little thicker also. I don't know why the company started using Mexico to make them but I wished they would go back to China because the old ones are a lot better. I went to a store that sells them and checked them all and they are all made in Mexico. I think the old ones are more comfortable also.,3, Black,7.0,5.0,15,2016

They rubbed uncomfortably across my arches and where the button strap joined the clog. The straps are too short for the size of the clog, and couldn't flip up over the arch.

This pair (made in Mexico) does not fit, they are too big.  They also feel thinner and even the straps that normally just fold up out of the way are not the same size.  If this is the new Crocs then I will find another brand and shame on the company for ruining a good product. If these are counterfeit, then shame on the supplier.  As always Amazon's return policy is quick & easy, however I  will still be paying $5 shipping.

Pamela J. Peerce Landers,Classic Crocs Fit Much Smaller,"  If you are replacing a pair of old Classic Crocs today, be aware that the fit is much smaller. The length is 1/2 inches shorter. The width is narrower.  And, the strap is no longer flush with the back of the shoe, but 1/2 inch shorter. Result, a very tight uncomfortable shoe.The material of construction is also more rigid and less pliable.  New Crocs are more like Walmart knock-offs than like the original Crocs.I returned mine.  Will shop locally since sizing is now problematic. If shoes are rigid, will just wear my old ones into the ground.",1, Navy,9.0,7.0,155,2015
Greek Witch,Does not fit the fat,"  At 8 lbs a pop, I have what you might call fat feet. My whole life has been spent in envy of those endowed with more normal locomotory appendages. I can't wear sneakers, sandals, or loafers; sock after sock has split after insertion of my foot therein; each of my footsteps is a distinctive *splat* audible over a 100 meter radius. I thought that maybe, just maybe, Crocs would help me ""fit"" in. I've seen plenty of people wearing them around the trailer park - just once, might I be able to look like the cool kids? I was dead wrong. With the XXXL Crocs on my feet, I understood what Chinese foot binding must have felt like. Blood flow to the foot region slowed to such a trickle that each foot turned a mucous green. I had to use a steak knife to get the things off, cutting myself in the process, so that what little blood remained in my feet spurted all over my den and onto my adjacent daughter. I walked to the ER barefoot, cutting my feet yet further on the broken glass that littered the freeway shoulder. The nurses on staff snickered at me from behind their COVID masks. Moral of the story, you ask? Keep away from ""Crocs"" at all costs.",1, Army Green,7.0,5.0,0,2020

I'm a size 9.5 men's and depending on the shoe, regular to extra wide width. I ordered these in a size 10 men's and they were huge all the way around, about a 1/2"" on every side and nearly an inch too big front to back. It would probably take a few layers of thick socks to fit correctly. I'd say a size 9 men's would fit fine.",1, Black,12.0,10.0,0,2020
MMP,Crocs Review Correction,"  I originally left a positive review but after wearing these Crocs the size was just too small.  I purchased a pair of Khaki Crocs in April this year from Amazon and the size was perfect.  These Crocs were definitely smaller.  I thought I could make it work but then decided to return.  I was not offered to exchange for another pair.  This made me think that they know that this color in their Crocs was mis-sized.  If they would have offered another pair sized correctly, I would have definitely exchanged.  The color is really nice.",1, Ice Blue,10.0,8.0,0,2020
PR,Not all crocs are made equally,"  I have gotten two pairs of crocs off of the actual website and I was pleased with them. When I saw Amazon had some at a cheaper price, I decided to try them using prime wardrobe. As soon I got them and tried them on, I immediately noticed a difference. The toe box was a little smaller and my feet would slide out when I would walk. I compared them to the crocs I got on the website, and the ones from Amazon definitely looked lower quality. The ""crocs TM"" logo across the strap wasn't as defined and the edges along the sides of the shoes weren't as smooth. The grips on the inside of the shoe weren't as defined either which is probably why my feet would slide out.. I looked at the tags and the ones I got from Amazon were made in Brazil while my other crocs from the website were made in Vietnam. I did research online and found that Crocs indeed has multiple factories across the globe, so the ones I were sent were likely NOT fakes. However, I am not the first person to note that the factories in Asia use a different mold than the ones in Brazil. Other people have also noticed a higher quality from the ones made in Vietnam. I TRIED to get myself to like these ones, but I just couldn't. Even if they were cheaper, I could TELL they were cheaper just by looking at them. I had to send them back. It's a shame that Crocs doesn't require the same mold and quality at all their locations. The lack of consistency is disappointing.",2, White,6.0,4.0,0,2020

Disappointed.","  I purchased the ""classic"" Crocs directly from the Crocs website about a year ago and was very satisfied with their fit and comfort etc.  I was hoping these same style ""classic Crocs (through Amazon) would fit the same.  Unfortunately, even though I purchased the exact same size, they are very small in comparison to my other classic Crocs.  In addition, the left shoe was noticeably tighter then the right.  The little bumps on the sole of each shoe are very pointy and irritating.  Why do Crocs length and fit differ so much each time I order the exact same size and style?!?!  Waste of money.

D. Deutsch,now I've got a pair too,"  I finally bought a pair of Crocs after finding them for the reasonable price of $19.99 on Amazon. I like Crocs, but I refuse to pay something like $30 to $45 for what essentially amounts to a pair of plastic slippers. I was skeptical of their usefulness, but they fill the niche (for me) between slippers and clogs pretty well.The fit was surprisingly small. I mean they are wide and clunky, but seem to run a bit short; I bought the 9 for my 8 1/2 foot, but there is not as much room in the toe-box as I expected. Despite being plastic, the shoes breathes very well and are comfortable enough for extended wear. Running to the mailbox or cleaning the house is an ideal use for this type of footwear. Beware taking out the garbage in the morning as the dew seeping through the holes will come as unwelcome surprise.Not that I knew I needed them, but Crocs are popular for a reason.  They are great for lounging around, but I am skeptical at the touted advantages of some of the more specialized models. Now, having bought a pair I feel existentially complete.Update 10/12/2012I am writing this review after about a week's worth of wear. The fit was simply too small and I had to give them away. I am trying the men's size 10 to see if they will be more comfortable. In my case it may be a matter of going a full size up.",2, Black,11.0,9.0,0,2012

TLC,Just Ok,"  I am a woman who wears a size 10. The length is exaxt, and while I do understand the sizes were unisex, these are extremely wide for a normal sized ladies foot. My foot slides side to side in them. I also thought there would be at least a 1/2"" lift from front to back since there appears to be deep sole, however it is actually totally flat because your heel sits lower than the top edge of the heel. There are air holes that go around the front and sides of the shoe, and one in the front is in the exact place that my second toe sticks through it and debris gets in. The strap can swing frontward or backwards, however when it's backwards, it barely touches my heel since it's so long. It's not as cushy soft as other crocs I've tried on. They are something to kick around in, but nothing I would have bought had I tried them on at the store. I think I will stick to the ones made specifically for women.",2, Black,10.0,8.0,0,2012

They are almost too large, especially in the width of the heal and the length of the strap.  My foot will barely stay in these if I rely on the strap.  I quickly compared these to my older pairs to verify I'd ordered the same style and size. They are all made in Mexico and were the same size and style, but there were several differences in mold marks that made it clear these were made from a different mold.

como651,A health Hazard,"  I used to love Crocs.  My first pair were the Classics then I got the slippers then the Yukon Sports and told everyone how great they were.  I could not have been so far from the truth.  These shoes keep podiatrists in business.  After 3 years of wearing my Classics nearly every day of the summer and spring I started to feel a growing discomfort in my knees when walking and especially when going down steps and began to suspect the Crocs when I noticed uneven treadwear.  I went to a podiatrist and he said the Crocs due to their spongy sole where not providing support or stabilizing my knees correctly.  He said I was experiencing pronation as a result which explained the uneven tread wear. He recommended Keen shoes instead.  I tried them on and it was immediate relief.  I could literally feel the pressure redistribute in my knees.  It felt like someone opened a pressure valve within my knee joints!  I also learned Crocs act as isolators and cause static electricity buildup which explains now why I regularly would get shocked when stepping out of my van.  Lastly, they are slippery as snot on wet concrete.  Almost went down several times.  They may feel soft on the feet but these things are the devil in disguise.",1, Black,13.0,11.0,37,2011

I only used the purple ones during the summer. The other day I was cleaning out my closet and found this khaki crocs, and I no longer want them.

Helen Murray,Inconsistent shoe sizes,"  I ordered two pairs of Crocs - one pair of thongs and one pair of cayman crocs. I used the sizing chart provided and ordered both pairs in M5/W7. However, when they arrived, while the Thongs fit perfectly, with room to wiggle, the Caymans were way too small (I'd almost say a full size too small). The Thongs were ""made in China"" and the Caymans ""made in Mexico"". I went to my local store and discovered that they receive Croc orders which are often made in multiple countries. It would appear to me that there is no ""standard"" mold used. So beware - just because you have tried them on in a store and think you have the correct size - you may end up getting a larger or smaller size, depending on where they are manufactured.",2, Khaki,7.0,5.0,490,2008

Sabb0r,No Title,"  Wir haben gleich 3 Paar dieser Schuhe in unterschiedlichen Gr√∂√üen und Farben gekauft. Da wir diese Schuhe im Garten und auf der Terrasse benutzen wollten, lagen sie bei uns immer drau√üen. Nach einigen Tagen in der Sonne sind sie so eingeschrumpelt, dass man unm√∂glich noch seinen Fu√ü hinein bekommt. Die schwarze 43/44 passt h√∂chstens noch jemandem mit Schuhgr√∂√üe 36, und die dunkelblaue 42/43 kann niemand mehr tragen, da sie sich zus√§tzlich auch noch vorne extrem nach oben gebogen haben und jetzt gute Clownsschuhe beim Kinderfasching w√§ren. Das dritte Paar hat sich nur ein wenig verzogen, vermutlich weil es die hellblauen waren und da die Sonne nicht so draufbrezelt. Geht jedenfalls √ºberhaupt nicht f√ºr den Preis!

Da ich sie haupts√§chlich im Garten und auf der Terrasse benutzt habe, standen sie logischerweise auch mal in der Sonne - mit dem Ergebnis, dass sie nach nur 3-4 Wochen mindestens 3 Gr√∂√üen geschrumpft sind! Im ersten Moment dachte ich, dass ein Kind seine Schuhe aus Versehen bei uns stehen gelassen hat, weil ich mir gar nicht erkl√§ren konnte, wieso ich pl√∂tzlich nicht mehr in die Schuhe passte!Dabei wirbt der Hersteller mit ""der perfekte Schuh f√ºr Strand oder Boot!""

Westyman,No Title,  Crocs sizing drives me mad. With both UK and US sizes and then even the UK sizes are incompatible with my feet. Normally a size 8 and knowing they're always on the large size I ordered a UK7 and this is still too big.,1, Navy,10.0,8.0,9,2018
Cocohoney,No Title,"  They have changed the shape and feel of Classic Crocs which I think is a shame. I prefer the rounded wide front and squishiness of my old style crocs, these are considerably narrower at the front. I'm sure they have done this to try and make them less disagreeable to the anti-croccers, but actually they look more silly in their new slimline shape. They are also firmer- I preferred them soft.",3, Black,12.0,10.0,16,2016
ALF,No Title,"  I ordered these for my husband as a Christmas present.  He is size 7 so clicked on that size.  When they arrived they were good quality but looked too big, so Christmas surprise spoilt for him as I had to ask him to try them on just in case they were OK - but no they were much to big.  When I checked to bottom of the Crocs it said size 8.When you order the sizing chart shows mens size 7/women size 8 which I presume is wrong as generally women have smaller feet but quite what determines which size you get who knows a crystal ball maybe. I have had to return them so a complete waste of my time and a Christmas surprise spoilt.I now have a dilemma,  do I re-order size 6 hoping to get size 7 or just forget the whole thing.I noticed in the reviews that the quality is not generally in question but that wrong sizing  is a frequent complaint so maybe time the production information was corrected and customers stopped wasting their time..",1, Deep Green,10.0,8.0,0,2020
Countess Perpetua,No Title,"  Others have commented on the strange sizing of Crocs, which seems to depend on whether they're made in Italy or China. I already had a pair of size 7s, which are roomy, so I only wear them round the house and garden.  And my son wears them (he's a size 9).  I needed something big to wear following a broken ankle so ordered a pair of black size 7.  They arrived and were visibly much smaller than the ones I already had. Small pair made in Italy, large pair made in China, both purporting to be size 7.  Really annoying.  I exchanged for a size 8 which is about the right size on my 'normal' foot - but I'm not usually an 8!Surely such a well known brand should be able to get its sizing right!",2, Black,9.0,7.0,32,2013
Mrs Piglet,No Title,"  The soles inside most Crocs have very small, slightly raised bobbles, presumably to invigorate one's feet, except these can cause nerve damage over time to diabetics' feet like my husband's and he has many various wide styles of other shoe makes bought from Amazon and been very satisfied. Eventually after only a fortnight, his Crocs were causing considerable nerve pain, so he bought gel insoles to prevent further discomfort.Otherwise Crocs are very comfy. They come in a variety of great colours and whose straps help keep one's feet safety inside the shoe.I wrote to Crocs many times, only to receive no reply.",2, Navy,16.0,14.0,0,2020

The bottoms of my feet were too painful to persevere and further.By the raised areas, I mean the many bumps in the shoes.I printed a label and sent these crocs back to you last week so you should  have received them by now.

C. JONES,No Title,"  I usually buy Croc lookalikes (or mock crocs as I refer to them) from a well known high street shoe shop, but they seem to wear down on the heel quite quickly, so I thought I'd try the branded one's. I have wide feet, so purchase men's size 7 in the mock croc version. Other reviewers stated that sizing depended greatly on where their Crocs were made, but as I had no idea in advance which version I would receive, I thought I should stick with a size 7. I have to say mine are a little on the small side - not only narrower but also shorter in length. I wear them instead of slippers, so during the summer months they fit fine, but I cannot wear them with socks once it gets cooler - there simply isn't enough room in them. I think in future I will stick with the 2 pairs for ¬£8.00 mock crocs, and just replace them more often. I find it rather ironic that a cheaper high street pair, is more generously sized than the expensive branded version.",3, Black,9.0,7.0,0,2015

I fully undertand they are designed and purposefully and made to a style "" loose fitting"" for comfort . But the one thing for us ""inbetweeners"", and I have experienced this with plenty of other footwear design/manufacturers is that it would be extremely useful if our Italian cousins who apparently made them (unless their plant is with our Far Eastern Cousins?). Would it be possible to suggest that theythey consider makig  a (1/2 half size ) through the perceived popular average range for for UK market feet i.e. some half sizes from 7 through to 11 1/2Love the Colour ,love the design the grip underneath,would just preferred a half 1/2 size bigger (8&1/2) ,would have been totally  satisfied.

So, as a result, I have about six pairs never worn because they are too big such a waste of money so I would be very reluctant to purchase another pair going forward.Don't get me wrong I love the comfort of Crocs but I'm not going to waste any more money it's just not worth it!!",3, Black,14.0,12.0,0,2020

However they are amazing at keeping your feet cool and they're very comfortable.

Mrs H A Nicholas,No Title,"  I was slightly disappointed by these. The insoles did not feel as comfortable or supportive as I'd hoped, and the size of the shoe was almost too short for my feet- it felt like my heel was hanging off the end of the shoe. However, width-wise, they felt too loose around my foot and wouldn't stay on unless I used the strap, which then pushed my foot forwards and squashed my toes. I wanted to use these as shoes/slippers to jump in and out of around the house, therefore they are no good for me and I will be returning them.",3, Chocolate,7.0,5.0,0,2016
terry latter,No Title,"  The bag they arrived in might have been correct...but the crocs weren't...I couldn't sort out the sizing on these...its a toss up between uk, us, chinese, korean and maybe eskimo.. i could almost get both feet in one croc, and I'm not small. Had to return them...",3, Khaki,12.0,10.0,1,2018
Marie Tassie,No Title,"  I bought these as advertised size 6. When they arrived it said on the sole, women's size 8 and men's size 6. I am keeping them as they might be better with socks, in winter. However, if this had been clear on the advert, I would have bought a smaller size. It didn't say on the description on Amazon that it was Unisex and gave absolutely NO indication that size 6 meant men's size 6 which is different from women's size 6!! Size 6, to me, is unisex as in all other shops/shoes, a men's (or boys') size 6 is the right size for me.I am keeping them as I needed them urgently for work and it's too much hassle to return them as I will have nothing to wear at work in the meantime but PLEASE in future make this sizing VERY clear!!",3, Navy,8.0,6.0,0,2014
Margaret F.,No Title,"  I have bought at least 20 pairs of Crocs and these are the first that don't quite fit. I would much rather have paid the extra ¬£10 and had a normal fit. The ones that I took off were sized 6 - 8 and made in Italy, just exactly the same as the new ones, but the new ones are slightly wider and have slightly bigger holes. Not happy, but these were the only Crocs on Amazon so no choice either.",2, Navy,8.0,6.0,0,2017
Parents in Touch,No Title,"  Gave these to my mother as a gift - bought at the same time as another pair for me which are perfectly sized. She has only just told me (as she didn't want to offend me) that she can't wear them as they are too small. On comparing them, although both pairs are marked Size 5, this pair is at least 2 sizes smaller and therefore unusable. Most disappointing as it's now too late to do anything about it.",1, Chocolate,7.0,5.0,5,2013
The ancient gardener,No Title,"  Ordered size UK7. When arrived, package said UK8 and sole said US8.

It was only when I checked my order, the label on the shoes, the label on the bag and the size on the bottom of the shoe that I realised that Amazon had despatched a size too large.

Lollypops,No Title,"  I bought these Crocs because I have other colours which I love, but these black ones appear to be of inferior quality.  The plastic is a lot harder and ungiving and therefore not nearly as comfortable.  Maybe they will soften in time, but I see no reason why a different colour should be any different in quality, especially as the price remains the same and I suspect these are manufactured by a different company, using cheaper materials.",3, Black,6.0,4.0,0,2015

Amazon Customer,No Title,"  I read various reviews about crocs before ordering, and gathered from most that the sizings can be hit or miss. I therefore ordered two different styles and two different sizes.Jolly glad that i did. My normal size is a 6, but the size 6 that i ordered looked more like a childs shoe. There was no way my feet were going to fit into those. The pair i ordered in a different size and style fitted perfectly.

Golfer,No Title,  I bought these for my sister they arrived very quickly even with the terrible weather conditions. The crocs were bought to replace an old pair made in Italy that fitted perfectly. It appears Crocs  are made in different countries and this pair looked perfect but were made in China and  at least a size too small. My sister returned the crocs and decided not to take a chance on the next size being a better fit and buy locally therefore able to try  on and save the possibly of having to return if wrong size. My advice  see if you can find out where they were made before buying and if China take a bigger size.  difficult to give a rating as the product is good but incorrectly sized.,3, Khaki,9.0,7.0,0,2011

Nun sind sie durchgelaufen, und einer an in der Sohle ein Loch. Deshalb mussten neue her.Ich habe die Gr√∂√üe, die 37/38 angegeben ist gekauft.Sie passen mir wie erwartet. Dennoch wundert es mich, das die alten eine Nummer kleiner waren, aber dennoch gr√∂√üer sind als die neuen.Also kauft jemand dieselbe Gr√∂√üe wie seine alten sind, werden sie viiiiiiiel zu gro√ü sein.Auf meinen alten steht noch ""Made in Italy"" auf den neuen ""Made in Vietnam"".

Dalibor Balta,No Title,"  Die Crocs wurden wie angek√ºndigt von Amazon geliefert. Zun√§chst passte auch alles. Habe absichtlich eine Nummer gr√∂sser bestellt. Die Schuhe waren angenehm zu tragen. Nach 5 Wochen und einigen Tagen aufenthalt der Crocs auf der Terasse waren diese um min. 2 Nummern geschrumpft. Zudem hatten sich die Schuhe so in L√§ngsachse verwunden das ein reinschl√ºpfen kaum m√∂glich ist. Das Tragen ist durch die Verwindung auch sehr unangenhem.Der Kundenservice von Amazon ist wirklich sehr freundlich. Ich bekomme ein neues Paar schuhe kostenlos zugeschickt. Ich werde es so gut wie m√∂glich vermeiden die Schuhe in praller Hitze liegen zu lassen, um die Schrumpfung und Verwindung zu vermeiden. Ich habe das Gef√ºhl das die Hersteller von dern urspr√ºnglichen Materialmischung abgewichen sind. Crocs trage ich seit 8 Jahren. Dieses Problem ist in diesem Umfang neu f√ºr mich.Ich bin mir am √ºberlegen ob ich 1 oder 2 Sterne geben soll. Ich gebe jetzt einen Stern, weil ich den Schuh eben meistens in den Sommermonaten trage.

Stephan Klein,No Title,"  Zun√§chst machen die Crocs einen vern√ºnftigen Eindruck. Aber nach nur ungef√§hr 7 Monaten passen die Schuhe √ºberhaupt nicht mehr, da sich die Sohle durchgebogen hat und die Schuhe nun deutlich zu klein sind. Dabei wurden die Schuhe in der Zeit (vor allem √ºber den Winter) nur wenig getragen.Bei dem zeitgleich bestellten Modell meiner Frau treten diese Probleme nicht auf. Allerdings sind diese auch ""Made in Italy"" und nicht wie bei mir ""Made in Mexico"". Insgesamt kann ich von diesem Kauf daher nur abraten.Nachtrag: Ich habe die schwarze Version bestrellt (Roomy Fit).",1, Black,13.0,11.0,7,2019
VincentV,No Title,"  Ich habe mir vor etwa einem halben Jahr ein Paar dieser Crocs bestellt und wollte dann noch ein zweites Paar in derselben Gr√∂√üe und selben Farbe.Als ich das zweite Paar erhielt, habe ich zuerst bemerkt, dass diese um einiges enger geschnitten waren als das Paar mit derselben Gr√∂√üenangabe und mir daher √ºberhaupt nicht passten. Bei genauem Hinsehen und Vergleich fiel mir dann auf, dass sich das neue auch sonst von meinem ""alten"" Paar unterschied. Mein altes Paar war laut Aufdruck Made in Vietnam, das neue Paar Made in Bosnia. Zudem war der neue Farbton d√ºnkler.Offenbar unterscheiden sich die Produkte aus den verschiedenen Herstellerl√§ndern doch massiv, daher besteht hier das Risiko, ein f√ºr einen ""schlechteres"" Paar zu erwischen, mein zweites Paar ging daher zur√ºck.",3, Slate Grey,14.0,12.0,2,2020

Me llegaron y como se ve en la fotograf√≠a hay mucha diferencia con la misma talla, me quedan muy peque√±as.Pens√© que lo mismo estaban mal mis anteriores blancas, es muy raro que el mismo fabricante cambie tanto de talla y las he utilizado sin cerrar por detr√°s.El tema es que compr√© a mi mujer otras en otro vendedor de color ROSA talla 39-40 que es el equivalente a ellos 7-9 y pude comprobar que incluso son m√°s grandes que las que compr√© 41-42.Al final se ha quedado mi mujer con las negras porque no hay nada peor que ir con un calzado peque√±o.Es decir son las tallas de este vendedor las que son m√°s peque√±as que las otras y eso quiere decir que o est√°n mal rotuladas o no son aut√©nticas",1, Black,10.0,8.0,1,2020

Max,No Title,"  Allora o sono io che ho problemi a comprare crocs su amazon o c'√® qualche problema di fondo con tutte le crocs made in Vietnam. Prima di queste avevo provato il modelo crocband (arrivate sempre made in vietnam) e gi√† con quelle avevo problemi di taglia e di dolore alle ginocchia per come era stata costruita male la pianta del piede. Dopo il primo reso per la taglia ho deciso di cambiare e di prendere il modello classico che conoscevo, sperando d andare sul sicuro. Arrivate, comode, il problema √® che le due scarpe sono di dimensioni diverse. Ma che bello. Entrambe hanno impresso lo stesso numero sulla suola ma la scarpa destra √® pi√π grande della sinistra, e la differenza si nota gi√† ad occhio nudo. Fantastico. Quindi ora dovendo fare l'ennesimo reso nasce il dilemma: quale delle due scarpe rappresenta la taglia giusta? Il ""39/40"" dichiarato dovrebbe essere la sinistra che mi calza perfetta, o la destra che mi calza larga? Tra parentesi, normalmente porto un 38/39. Quindi il dilemma √®: devo riordinare la stessa taglia o prenderne una pi√π piccola? Questo sempre sperando che le scarpe mi arrivino della stessa dimensione a sto giro e non sia un problema dell'intera partita. Cio√® dai. O sono sfigata io o non si pu√≤.",2, Neo Mint,9.0,7.0,0,2020

Nachdem das Profil komplett abgelaufen war, habe ich mir dann diese hier bestellt. Zu Anfang war alles einwandfrei, sie waren nur gef√ºhlt etwas enger als die alten. Zwischendurch habe ich mich gewundert, warum der eine Schuh pl√∂tzlich dr√ºckt und reibt, aber nicht weiter dar√ºber nachgedacht warum. Den Sommer √ºber standen sie dann unbenutzt neben der T√ºr, da ich √ºberwiegend barfu√ü oder mit Flipflops unterwegs war.

Daher kann man jedem nur davon abraten, diese ""Schuhe"" im Freien zu benutzen.

Jackson F,No Title,  Well I should have taken more note of the other reviews! I have bought  many pairs of crocs for family members over the last two years but noted the comment about the change in sizing so ordered as advised - when the came they were much  much smaller than the the same sized Crocs bought a year ago; those were made in China the latest were made in Italy. Another reviewer expressed frustration that a company like Crocs cant get its suppliers to produce to a consistent size standard and I agree. You might as well buy locally - there are plenty of Croc lookalikes to choose from at a much lower price and they might not last as long but at least you know they fit,1, Chocolate,10.0,8.0,3,2016

Kaum ein Schuh passt, weil die Gr√∂√üen keiner Norm entsprechen und sogar innerhalb eines Modells die Schuhe unterschiedlich gro√ü ausfallen. Das h√§ngt wohl damit zusammen, ob der Schuh in Asien oder Europa hergestellt worden ist (wird tats√§chlich in mehreren L√§ndern produziert, wobei die Italiener die besseren Schuhe herstellen). Manchmal miefen die Plastik-Clogs, jedenfalls die in Asien produzierten. Tragekomfort konnte ich nich feststellen. Das 41er Modell dr√ºckte an den Zehen, dass 42er schlappte, im geheizten Zimmer schwitze der Fuss in dem Plastik (trotz Bel√ºftungsl√∂chern). 2 Zehner zahlt man f√ºr den Namen, bestimmt nicht f√ºr Verarbeitung und so ein billiges Material.",1, Navy,10.0,8.0,0,2013

Margaret O'Connor,No Title,"  I suffer from plantar fasciatis in both heels and was recommended these crocs by a friend who had suffered from the same ailment and got great relief from this type of shoe.  Within half an hour of putting them on I was in complete agony and spent several hours afterwards off my feet as I was unable to even hobble, never mind walk.  Needless to say I was very disappointed as I expected to be able to walk easier and relatively pain free once I wore them.  However, they did arrive in excellent time and were comfortable once I put them on, shoe size, width etc. was spot on.  My problems only began once I actually started to walk in them.  Perhaps this type of shoe helps mild plantar fascitis but it is definitely not good for the more debilitating type.

Hellbilly,No Title,"  Ich muss hier vorweg sagen das ich nur mal eine 5-Euro-Kopie der Schuhe hatte und diese nach 6 Monaten weggeworfen habe. Soweit so gut und hab mir hier die Originalen bestellt nachdem ich mich wegen den Gr√∂√üen erkundigt hatte.Mir sind Schuhe in 44 immer passend wenn nicht sogar ein wenig zu gro√ü und hatte hier 44/45 bestellt. Nach meinem Empfinden sind diese 43-43,5 in deutscher Gr√∂√üe. Zum Sitzen geeignet aber mehr nicht. Bin sehr leicht vorne angesto√üen bzw. es hat gedr√ºckt. Also Versandkosten zahlen und zur√ºck. Hier direkt ein Tipp: aufpassen bei WEM man bestellt! Hatte bei einem H√§ndler die Schuhe bezogen und dieser hatte keinen kostenlosen R√ºckversand. Au√üerdem waren die Schuhe in keiner anderen Gr√∂√üe mehr vorhanden. Gibt bei Amazon √∂fters mal kostenlosen R√ºckversand oder ihr bestellt euch direkt 2 Gr√∂√üen und eine geht retour. Als Anhaltspunkt k√∂nnt ihr nehmen 26cm Fu√ül√§nge ist 44/45, alles was dr√ºber ist gr√∂√üer bestellen.Hab mir die Crocs nochmal in 45/46 bestellt und bin gespannt ob diese passen (war im Schuhladen testen :))Ach ja da hier immer wieder mal das Produktionsland erw√§hnt wird, meine waren aus Mexiko und hatten den ganz normalen Geruch von neuen Plastikschuhen.

This Anomaly is confusing, particularly for online purchases.When I tried for return / cancellation option, the refund is limited to basic cost (Rs. 1764/- in this case) and balance Rs. 1300/- towards import / freight is to be absorbed by customers - which is a unfair burden.On screen the price indicated is Rs.1764/- but when you place order the cost comes to Rs. 3056/- which should be indicated initially.

Jutta Sachs,No Title,"  Leider musste ich feststellen, dass diese nicht gerade billigen Schuhe eine absonderliche Eigenschaft besitzen: Sie schrumpfen, wenn man sie in der Sonne oder in der Tageshitze drau√üen stehen l√§sst - nicht eine, nicht zwei, auch nicht drei, sondern bis zu vier Nummern.Meine Frau hat der ganzen Familie Crocs bestellt, mir selbst welche in Gr√∂√üe 42-43. Gedacht waren sie als Gartenschuhe oder f√ºrs Freibad, jedenfalls f√ºr drau√üen, was mir als Verwendungszweck nicht ganz abwegig erscheint. Doch nach einigen Tagen, an denen es recht hei√ü war, glaubte ich, die Schuhe verwechselt zu haben und die meines √§lteren Sohnes angezogen zu haben.Allerdings hatte die nun mein j√ºngerer Sohn an, weil seine nahezu auf Puppengr√∂√üe geschrumpft und sich bananenartig gebogen hatten. Das gleiche Ph√§nomen zeigte sich bei den Schuhen meiner Frau und meines gr√∂√üeren Sohnes.Nach l√§ngerem Gr√ºbeln kam ich zu dem Schluss, dass wohl alle Schuhe geschrumpft sein mussten und bei Nachforschungen im Internet durfte ich feststellen, nicht allein mit diesem Problem zu sein.CROCS schrumpfen bei Hitze in der Sonne, jedenfalls diejenigen, die wir erhalten haben - und auch diejenigen anderer.Dies sind die ersten Schuhe, bei denen mir Derartiges passiert ist.Meine Schuhe mit Gr√∂√üe 42-43 passen nun nicht mal mehr meiner Frau mit Schuhgr√∂√üe 39.Diese Schuhe sind zum Wegwerfen.Ich werde mir jedenfalls keine mehr kaufen und kann sie gewiss niemandem empfehlen, da es auch kein vereinzelter Vorfall ist, wie jeder nachgoogeln kann.",1, Black,11.0,9.0,5,2014
G. D. Moreno,No Title,"  Y es por el precio y por el aparente ""√©xito"" de dicho calzado que me decid√≠ a probarlas.Primeramente quer√≠a decir que la talla es de broma. Pido unas 39/40 alarmado por los comentarios de otros compradores y a√∫n as√≠ me sobra zapato. Es grande...Despu√©s de investigar un poco sobre las crocs he llegado a la conclusi√≥n de que no son un zapato de calle. Buscad y leed que pueden ocasionar problemas musculares si andais mucho con ellas. O que la etiqueta que traen y que advierte de tener precauci√≥n en las escaleras mec√°nicas es porque ya ha habido gente lesion√°ndose con ellas... algunas muy gore....Para mi suerte, yo buscaba hacerles un uso 100% dentro de casa como zapatillas de estar por casa.Y CUMPLEN porque:1 Amortiguan muy bien la pisada y tienen una zona de masaje por todo el pie (si hace algo o no, ni idea, pero ah√≠ est√° y se nota).2 De momento no cogen olores raros (salvo su pl√°stico caracter√≠stico)3 Son c√≥modos y protegen el pie de golpes contra picos y patas de los muebles (al ser goma (o lo que sea) no notas dolor al impactar accidentalmente en cosas)4 Son antideslizantes SIIIII y da igual si pisas lo fregado que no deslizas. Pero ojo, que la bronca de tu pareja / padres por pisarles lo recien fregado no te la quita nadie.De todas formas y desde un punto de vista pr√°cticos tienen DEFECTOS....1) 42 euros.... estamos locos? que es un pol√≠mero (pl√°stico) insertado en un molde y ya est√°.2) El pie suda... Yo me pongo calcetines para no sentir tanto el tacto directo y a√∫n as√≠ las zonas con mucho contacto con el material sin agujeros suda y el calcet√≠n puessss algo si que se nota h√∫medo.3) Se rozan facilmente y pierden material de la suela (que se desgastan r√°pido, vamos).Mi conclusi√≥n es que puede que repita (a precios amazon) este calzado PARA USARLO POR CASA. O incluso entiendo gente que est√° mucho tiempo de pie y las usen para trabajar pues son c√≥modos y el pie respira m√°s que con otro calzado cerrado.PERO NO ES UN CALZADO DE CALLE... da problemas musculares, se desgastan r√°pido y es antiest√©tico.",2, Chocolate,9.0,7.0,5,2016

ferrofluid,No Title,"  Leider ist bei diesen Crocs in der Farbe Braun tats√§chlich das wahr geworden, was schon mehrere K√§ufer in ihren Rezensionen berichtet haben: die Crocs sind in der Sonne geschrumpft.Gekauft im April haben sie nun gut 3 1/2 Monate im Freien auf der s√ºdseitigen Terrasse verbracht und auch gute Dienste beim Rasenm√§hen, Badmintonspielen und im Gem√ºsegarten getan. Nun sind sie von Gr√∂√üe 40 auf ca Gr√∂√üe 38 eingegangen - nun passen sie nicht mehr meiner Mutter, sondern meiner 14-j√§hrigen Nachbarin :)Gerade an der Fersenpartie sind sie erheblich schm√§ler geworden, aber auch in der L√§nge geschrumpft.Ansonsten waren die Crocs vom Tragegef√ºhl und von der Haltbarkeit bisher sehr gut, auch der Preis mit gut 16 ‚Ç¨ war sehr g√ºnstig. Aufgrund des Schrumpfens aber, vor allem schon nach so kurzer Zeit, gibt es von mir leider nur zwei Sterne, da sie von meiner Mutter so nicht mehr getragen werden k√∂nnen.Eine gute Alternative zu diesem Modell haben wir allerdings schon gefunden:¬†Crocs Crocband Unisex  , die sich seit dem gleichen Zeitraum sehr gut auf unserer Terrasse schlagen und auch noch nicht eingegangen sind (gleich zwei Paar in ""parrot green"" made in Mexico und ""ultramarine"" made in Bosnia).Diese sind zwar etwas teurer, aber das ist das ""Nichtschrumpfen"" wert :)",2, Chocolate,9.0,7.0,3,2016

Im Mai habe ich sie zum ersten Mal beim Ostseeurlaub (Fr√ºhlingswetter) getragen. Ich war geschockt, als ich am n√§chsten Tag feststellen musste, dass sich das Material komplett verzogen hatte und das Produkt wie geschrumpft erschien. Das Resultat waren unangenehme Druckstellen an den Fu√üinnenseiten und Zehen, da kein Platz mehr blieb. Sofort habe ich die Schuhe reklamiert und anstandslos ein neues Paar geschickt bekommen. Auf dem Foto ist der Unterschied ersichtlich: es ist dieselbe Gr√∂√üe! Ich hatte das Ersatzpaar nicht direkt gebraucht und erst k√ºrzlich verwendet, aber die Freude war von kurzer Dauer. Auch das Material des Ersatzpaares hat sich komplett verformt, ohne dass die Schuhe der prallen Sonne ausgesetzt waren.

B. Kienzle,No Title,"  Habe die Crocs verschenkt. Die Beschenkte hat nach drei Wochen die Schuhe zum ersten Mal ohne Str√ºmpfe getragen. Nach zwei Stunden sind die F√º√üe angeschwollen und feuerrot geworden. Es wurde so schlimm, dass ein Arztbesuch unumg√§nglich wurde. Der hat eine Entz√ºndung diagnostiziert und Antibiotika verordnet. Nach drei Tagen Antibiotika und kalten Umschl√§gen, gingen die Beschwerden langsam weg. Es ist ja m√∂glich, dass nicht jeder so reagiert, aber Artikel die solche Beschwerden verursachen, d√ºrften nicht verkauft werden.Ich werde keinesfalls mehr schwarze Crocs kaufen.",1, Black,10.0,8.0,0,2018

B.H.,No Title,"  Bestellt hatte ich ein Paar Crocs ""Made in Italy"", gekommen sind Schuhe ""Made in China"". Mein letztes Paar Original Crocs kam auch aus China und nachdem diese einige Tage auf der sonnigen Terrasse standen waren sie auf Kindergr√∂√üe geschrumpft (von Gr√∂√üe 41 auf 36!!!). Dieses Ph√§nomen tritt wohl gerne auf bei Schuhen ""Made in China"", wie ich in diversen Bewertungen nachlesen konnte. Deshalb hatte ich mich eigentlich f√ºr diese Schuhe hier entschieden, da auf dem Bild deutlich erkennbar war, dass die Schuhe aus Italien kommen - war aber leider nicht der Fall.

Housemartin,No Title,"  Amazon Prime is amazing! You can get the wrong size delivered the very next day - not once, ladies and gentlemen, not twice, boys and girls, but THREE TIMES! I ordered size 10 and I keep receiving size 11. It's taken me 64 years for my feel to grow to size 10, I'm not sure how long they'll take to reach 11. I could stuff the packaging into these size 11 Crocs to pad them out a bit, I suppose. I've looked on Amazon for a pair of size 11 feet, but any search involving body parts is frowned upon, it seems. I'd like to review the product, they look fine, and I'm sure that if I ever received a pair that fitted they'd do the job nicely, but without a road test a review would be meaningless. So, back goes another pair. Which way is the High Street .......?",1, Navy,13.0,11.0,3,2016

Digor,No Title,"  Crocs sind praktische Hausschuhe, bequem, schnell an und auszuziehen, d√§mpfen die Schritte auf Parkett/Dielen, halten die F√º√üe warm ohne schwitzen (zumindest bei mir). Merkw√ºrdig jedoch, dass die Firma Crocs das mit den Gr√∂√üen nicht hinbekommt. Ich wollte mir neue Crocs gleicher Gr√∂√üe bestellen. Auf meinen alten Crocs stehen die Zahlen 10 und 12. Leider muss ich hier bei Amazon die Gr√º√üen in 43/44 etc. ausw√§hlen. Also auf die Crocs Homepage, um dort an Hand einer Gr√∂√üentabelle abzugleichen, welche Gr√∂√üe ich bestellen muss, um wieder ein Paar der Gr√∂√üe 10 und 12 zu erhalten. Aber Fehlanzeige, auch auf der Crocs Homepage ist nur von 43/44 etc. die Rede.Also mutig 43/44 bestellt und siehe da, es stehende Zahlen 10 und 12 auf der Unterseite der Crocs. Und trotzdem sind diese einen Tick kleiner, obwohl es sich bei beiden um die Classic handelt. Au√üerdem scheint das Material h√§rter, die Crocs d√§mpfen weniger, die Noppen im Fu√übett dr√ºcken beinahe unangenehm.",3, Black,12.0,10.0,4,2016

Windydotcom,No Title,"  These genuine Crocs were not a UK size 12 as advertised and as per the Crocs label.  I have been buying my Dad size 12 Crocs for years without any problem with the sizing.  His Crocs that fit have the number 12 on the sole.  These had a number 13 on the sole but the label clearly stated ""UK 12"".  They were too big.  My Dad has mobility issues and having shoes that fit is imperative to his being able to walk safely and confidently.  Unfortunately I could not return as I trusted the label which I had removed and had written my Dad's name on (he lives in a care-home).

stargazer,No Title,  Per qualche motivo [probabilmente economico] Crocs ha cambiato il disegno dell' interno delle scarpe. Io ho un paio di Crocs Classic Sabot che ho comprato 5 anni fa e sembrano imbottite in qualche modo. Sono morbide e molto comode. Pero' le suole sono consummate e quindi sono molto pericolose sul bagnato. Adesso invece le scarpe dentro sono dure e dopo poco tempo danno fastidio al piede. Sono diventate come qualsiasi altra imitazione delle Crocs che si trovano in giro per meno della meta'.,1, Navy,12.0,10.0,7,2015

Heidi Bumanlag,How Crocs Changed My Life,"  I will admit, I once was a hater. I lived a hateful negative life where I truly despised this footwear. But recently I've made many drastic life changes and these shoes have helped me see the light. They have helped me to see the beauty of the world and give me the confidence to face whatever obstacles life may throw my way. I can now walk outside with confidence. These shoes, these marvelous shoes, help me to live my life to the fullest not only in style but with such comfort no amount of words can begin to describe. I will now continue to live my life with an open mind to such fashion statements. No more will I live with my head hung low, but now I wear my crocs with pride. Sports mode empowers me while relaxed mode truly is the epitome of serenity. Crocs have also been the glue that has bonded me and one my best friends. Crocs truly change your life and bring people together. I will forever be indebted to this spectacular shoe.",5, Lemon,7.0,5.0,1920,2019
A. Roumie,Call me a Croc Enthusiast!!,"  I LOVE THESE THINGS!! They're stylish and functional. These shoes are the future. It is not hard to pull them off with any outfit. Wear them to school, wear them to run errands, wear them to church! I sure do! Nothing can compare to these wonderful shoes.These shoes really show individuality. With a variety of colors and endless shoe charms, you can express who you are in a unique and fashionable way. Be a trend setter with Crocs, the shoes that should have never gone out of style!",5, Navy,10.0,8.0,515,2017
Jeanne,Freesail vs Classic,"  I own 2 pair of Crocs women's Freesail and figured I'd try a pair of the classics.  The Freesail are much trimmer & narrower in width than the  women's Classics.  I love both.  The Classics are quite a bit boxier and wider in width  than the Freesail and the Classics seem to have a bit more  cushioning on the bottom.  Both work well for my problem feet which are usually sporting the Alegria brand shoes/sandals  for work.  However, on weekends and downtime, I prefer Crocs.  I have hammer toes  and deteriorating foot joints and have lost most of natural cushioning on the bottom of my feet making it feel like I'm walking on marbles. I typically wear a women's 8/12 or a European size  39.  In Crocs, I always  go a size 9 for the length.  I love both the Freesail and Classics and would urge anyone with ""touchy feet"" to give these a try.",5, White,9.0,7.0,323,2017
FLRL,Cutest Comfy Ugly Shoe You Can Buy,"  I bought this classic fit (wide) shoe in size 6 men to get a size 8 women's.  It fits perfectly.  Most comfortable shoe or clog ever.  They are also ugly but they are so ugly that they are cute. To be clear, I bought these to wear with fluffy socks so I have the room I need (my feet are not wide) when wearing the fluffy socks. The strap can be in the back or in the front.  I like having it across my heel when wearing socks.  Feet don't sweat thanks to all of the vents.  You can also put cute little Jibbitz on them that people will notice and take their attention away from the ugly shoes.  You can wear these things all day, 10-12 hours and your feet and legs will hold out.  I got the original classic style because so many people online complained about the soles coming apart on the newer style.  So buyer beware, if you try them you will love them.",5, Black,8.0,6.0,211,2017
Tyler,and we like how easy it is to get them on,"  I never, ever thought I'd wear Crocs, but here I am.Our 1.5 year old daughter loves her Crocs, and we like how easy it is to get them on, how we don't have to fuss over socks, etc. They're great summer shoes for kids. After a while I started thinking about getting myself a pair just as yard work/grilling/fishing/etc. shoes for the same reason. Which is what they started as, but during one Home Depot trip I realized I never took them off and was wearing them out. Fair game, I guess I'm living the Croc life now.Regarding sizing, I saw some strange advice all over. And perhaps it's different between colors, so for clarity's sake I got the Khaki color. Anyway, I saw some people talking about sizing down, but I really don't think that's the right way to go. Crocs do feel loose on your feet, but just wear them around a bit and you'll realize that they're just fine and very secure. The bottom ""floats"" a little bit so you don't develop blisters, but the strap holds them to your feet pretty well. If this were a normal shoe, then I'd size down. But it's not, and it doesn't wear/stretch/weigh the same, so I recommend getting your true size. I'm a 12D, sometimes 11.5 or 12.5, and once in a blue moon a 13. Size 12 works fine for me here.",5, Khaki,14.0,12.0,178,2017

I have avoided crocs because they are big clown shoes in appearance and I didn't want look like a ...you know.  I finally bought a pair because I am now swimming regularly and needed shoes that could get wet at the pool.  I hate flip flops, which abrade the tender area between big toe and second toe.  Well, I bought the crocs and they are awesome!  Very comfortable.  I have arthritis in my feet and the crocs are surprisingly supportive.  I wear them for long drives.  They are great at the dog park or in the back yard where I am likely to step in something that is very difficult to clean off sneakers but comes off easily with a hose or a wipe from my clogs.  Best of all, I look cool in them, and I know this because the younger generation is impressed.  Not the 20 somethings, who tend to roll their eyes, or my contemporaries who look askance and ask if I have been gardening but the stylesetters of tomorrow.  I wore them to the beach and a toddler and a four year old both patted my shoes. Now I want crocs in every color of the rainbow.",5, Pool,8.0,6.0,680,2015
Chris Luiszer,Never thought I'd buy but very happy now,"  Never thought I'd buy a pair of crocs. I've been making fun of them for the past decade but when we moved into a new place with hard floors, I needed something to wear around the house. I stand/walk a lot at work and wanted something that was very comfortable.Got these bad boys and couldn't be happier. After a long day in dress shoes I look forward to wearing these when I get home. Great for working around the house and going up and down the stairs on hard flooring. I flip the strap up and go for the clog configuration. The look better that way and stay on fine without the strap behind your heel. Also nice that they are pretty grippy. I wear them cooking in the kitchen and don't have any issues when I spill stuff on the floor.I would definitely recommend these to anyone. They don't look the coolest but I'm a dad now so I'm fine with that. They are a much more comfortable upgrade from flip flop or slipper for wearing around the house. My only regret is not getting a cool color. If you're gonna get crocs you might as well go big!",5, Black,13.0,11.0,80,2017
WampThing,Comfy but there are size inconsistencies,"  I ordered 2 pairs of these crocs classics, cerulean and pepper. Pepper is a true red (I was worried it might look pink) and the cerulean is very blue, not purple at all. I usually wear men's size 8.5 shoes and an m8/w10 fit when tried on in a store. However I read lots of reviews that said the sizes were very inconsistent. I need these soon so don't have time to mess with exchanges so I ordered m8/w10 and m9/w11. They were exactly the same size. Width, length, everything was the same, it was weird. I think they fit more like a m9/w11 but that's fine. I wanted/expected these to be pretty loose like my old ones from over a decade ago. These are pretty comfy like I remember and hopefully they last like my old ones did. I didn't find them shiny, uncomfortably small/narrow or the nubs inside to be too painful, which were all common complaints. Overall I say try them on in store first especially if you're in between sizes. I have high hopes for these. (These are the made in mexico ones by the way)",4, Pepper,11.0,9.0,96,2017

Over the years I've had to return or give away shoes I carefully chose, cos only the front of my feet are wide (like a duck). Have to have some sort of strap, or tie on.  My siblings would urge me to try them, so I took the plunge. The 1st pair had to be returned because of a simply mistake at the factory; the wrong size was put in the box.  The replacement arrived yesterday, and I could turn cartwheels, if I could. So comfortable, roomy, and no breaking in period. With regular leather shoes, the little toe on my right foot is still squeezed; with the Crocs, no problem!  And it keeps my feet cool! These are officially my fav shoes.

I had to return the first pair I ordered since they were too large. So I went a size down and they fit perfectly! I couldn‚Äôt be happier with this purchase! Oh and I‚Äôve stepped in a massive pile of GSD üí© and it washes right off these adorable shoes. Perfect function so easy to clean. I‚Äôm literally hooked for life and I don‚Äôt know how I never bought üêä Croc‚Äôs before?!?!My order came in the time frame they said it would. It took about a week, with Prime. Worth the wait. I love the fact that they look good with everything I wear. I don‚Äôt dress up much so I wouldn‚Äôt recommend wearing them with an evening gown üòÇ but they are breathable and my feet don‚Äôt stink in these either. They were in new packaging too. I will get lots of use out of these for sure. They are super comfortable and actually feel great on my feet. All and all my new favorite house shoes üíØ!!! I definitely recommend this purchase to anyone out there who hasn‚Äôt tried these out before! They are amazing! Stay safe out there!",5, Bright Cobalt,9.0,7.0,17,2020
JGriffin,Comfy and Convenient,"  My husband wore crocs on our first date and I honestly almost ended it then, but I decided what the heck. Who cares what he wears on his feet?? Then he revealed that he usually wears his crocs with SOCKS. It‚Äôs freaking hideous and I have made fun of him for YEARS. But recently, I needed a pair of shoes to toss on to take the dog on quick walks or just run to the mailbox and he surprised me with a pair of these bad boys (in mint, my favorite color). I swore I wouldn‚Äôt wear them.. and yet, Here I am! Wearing them every stinkin day now!! These shoes are not stylish. They make your feet look like gigantic doll feet. But they are THE most comfortable and convenient shoes I‚Äôve ever worn. They are easy to clean, breathable and great for days at the beach or river. If my husband sees this, I admit I was wrong. I still won‚Äôt say that out loud, but here ya go.",5, Neo Mint,8.0,6.0,13,2020
Migue,Get them on sale! Worth every penny!,"  I‚Äôve actually always disliked crocks for some reason but something sparked inside my head while in quarantine and decided to give them a chance since I wouldn‚Äôt be leaving my house any time soon and no one would see me in them and honestly It was the best decision I‚Äôve ever made!I actually got them on sale $10 off so I only paid $32 bucks and I love them! The insole was a little uncomfortable the first few days of wearing them, they poke and feel wired and itch your feet s bit after you take them off but after wearing them a few days , I don‚Äôt even wanna take them off! Lol‚û°Ô∏è Sizing!!! ‚¨ÖÔ∏èI was skeptical about ordering them online because I don‚Äôt know my size in there size but after much research and reviews I figured out that crocks are more comfortable and suppose to fit big!I wear a Size 9.5 (men) and have a pretty wide foot and everywhere said to size one up so I got size 10 (men) and they fit perfectly and comfortably!Over all I would recommend a pair for everyone ! Went outside did some grading stuff rinsed them right off looked good as new!! Can‚Äôt wait to Customize them! 10/10 recommend!",5, Pepper,12.0,10.0,7,2020
martina machado,Crocs are my life,"  Where do I begin. If you do not own a pair of crocs by now, you need to buy yourself a pair right now. I used to buy ‚Äúcrocs‚Äù from the 99 cents store because I was on a budget, and by budget I mean absolutely broke. It wasn‚Äôt until I got my first job two years ago where I bought my first real pair and mannnn when I tell you that these are the most comfortable shoes ever, these are the most comfortable shoes ever. I can‚Äôt believe I was walking around in the knock off ones with no support, no wonder my back hurt so much. Well here I am two years later and I own 18 pairs of crocs. Everybody used to make fun of me but now I have people asking me for croc recommendations. If you are worried about looking dumb because these aren‚Äôt the cutest foot wear out there, these shoes are made to help you come as you are. If you are confident, it shines through. I almost have every color in the classic clogs and I am now going to invest in some bayaband, lite ride and bistro clogs. Crocs are an everyday, every moment type of thing for me and I am so glad that I am able to truly express myself through my beautiful crocs.I WILL SAY AS A SIDENOTE, those who experience discomfort, it may be because you have a flat foot as those with flat feet are better of wearing shoes like vans, converse, etc. (shoes that have no arch support)",5, Grass Green,7.0,5.0,8,2020
rabbit,Works great on my feet!,"  My chiropractor recommended wearing crocs since I started having plantar fasciitis problems. I usually wear woman's size 8 shoes, and got these in size 8. They seem a little big but it's actually more comfortable to wear that way, so I think these fit me perfectly. I like to life up the back holder part and wear them around like sandals. It's also nice when it's cold cause I can just slip them on with my socks on. As for dealing with my plantar fasciitis, it ended up working for me! I wore these every day, and at first I didn't notice that much of a difference and my feet ached in the morning for a while too, but around a year into wearing these, I have completely recovered from plantar fasciitis!! It's like I never even had plantar fasciitis before! I think it took a while for my feet to heal since it's something we use every day. Now I am able to wear normal flat sandals too and my feet are fine in the mornings. I still wear crocs and their brand sandals for my main footwear though, cause I think it helps to prevent plantar fasciitis from happening.",5, Pepper,8.0,6.0,8,2019
Nancy A. Ropecka,"Husband Hates the Look, LOVES the feel","  My husband has Plantar fasciitis (as I also have) and he has tried different inserts, balls to rub his feet on, exercises, etc.I have been wearing Crocs for over a year and they have alleviated my pain significantly, but he didn't like the way they looked.So, I decided to buy him a pair for Christmas, told him to just wear them around the house. He LOVES them. His feet are so much better, he takes his work shoes off the minute he gets in the house to put these on. I am so glad I bought them for him! He has actually talked to a couple of friends at work who told him they have been wearing them for years for the same reason!",5, Black,12.0,10.0,14,2018
Ms. Tee,BABYYYYY My feet are in Heaven,"  So full disclosure in this review so please don't judge. There aren't any Crocs stores in the area I live in but I heard they were really comfortable and good support for people who are on their feet all day. I have issues with my arches and typically wear arch supports in my shoes so that I can both walk better and so my feet don't hurt. When I don't wear my arch supports, my feet hurt and the pain radiates up to my knees and higher. I love to wear flip flops but if you are like me, your doctor told you heck no that's horrible for your feet.So, I purchased a bunch of ""garden"" shoes or fake crocs. Don't get me wrong these are amazing and I wear them all the time I just had no idea that they weren't real crocs. Let me try to explain.I saw the yellow colored crocs in DSW about 3 weeks ago and fell in love, but of course they didn't have any more even online in my size in yellow. I come to trusty old AMAZON and they are selling for more than $40. No thank you I will wait. I check out the CROCS site and with shipping its more than that. So I wait. I wait and wait until they drop down to $31 and change and I get em. Now you guys don't know me but I am just excited to add another color to my collection so I thought.I sprayed them down with Lysol after I open the zip lock bag they were in and sat them on my back porch you know for safety and all that good stuff. So I take the trash out and remember that they are out there so I bring em in and wash em off again because now they have outside germs even though no one has been on or near my back porch. I dry them off and put them on my feet.HALLELUJAH!!!!I thought I had ascended to heaven! You don't know the struggles I have with these here size 8's. The support I felt, the cushion I felt, the prinkly things in the shoe that massage my feet while feeling slightly weird when my toes touch them when I am sitting, it all was surreal. I woke up my brother. I went outside and screamed YES YES YES like I was a WWE wrestler. I immediately came back to amazon to look and see what color shoe I didn't have to order more.Needless to say, I look at price too and I can't afford any of these colors at this time but I LOVE MY YELLOW CROCS. I prefer crocs over sneakers or tennis but I wear tennis to protect my foot in case I feel like jogging or running.Buy you these shoes. Don't have any yet? Ain't nothing like the real thing is all I have to say.TRUST ME ON THIS ONE!Signed,A Satisfied customer",5, Lemon,8.0,6.0,4,2020
Simone Alicia,Whaaatt are thooossseee?!,"  Ordered a W8. This is my first pair of Crocs & I‚Äôm not sure whyyyyyy I waited this long to get a pair. Now I see why ppl use it. Very comfortable. I‚Äôm flat footed. I was able to wear it barefoot & also w| thin socks (tester around the house). The strap part to keep your feet in, it‚Äôs actually shorter than the actual length of the shoe (it‚Äôs not lined up with the heel part . Around a quarter of an inch or so from the heel) so when it goes around the back of your foot, it actually pushes your feel more inside the shoe. This isn‚Äôt a big deal for me as I‚Äôm actually a 7.5 women‚Äôs. I always love ordering any shoe item a half size bigger to have the extra room for thicker socks if needed. My Crocs were made in Mexico. I‚Äôve seen some complaints about sizing issues when it‚Äôs made in different countries. Anyways, I would recommend a pair to anyone.",5, Black,8.0,6.0,8,2019
Kate,Great versatile play shoes,"  We love crocs- all of my kids have a pair as their summer play shoes! We have a small farm and these are perfect- they can step in anything and hose off without a problem, wear them to play in the creek or the pond (if they come off in the pond they float and are easily retrievable!), and the versatility of wear with the heel strap makes it great for super active kids that like to run. I purchased this pair for my oldest, and as usual they are slightly bigger but we expected that. Great product.",5, Navy,8.0,6.0,6,2020
elliot :-),"The advice is to go a size down, but I suggest going a size up!","  I love these shoes! Crocs are silly looking yes, but that is what I love about them! I'm writing this review mainly just to note that in the description, it advises that if you're a half size to go a size down, since crocs can be large fitting/wide. However, this wasn't the case for me. I'm a size 7 and 1/2 in womens, so I chose a size 7, but I had to return it as I found it too tight fitting. If you fit size 8 converse just fine, then you most likely have feet similar to mine, so I'd recommend going a size up! Even without socks, it was uncomfortable enough for me to have to return it for a larger size.Besides the size issue, the shoes are wonderful! The coupon is also a great deal.",5, White,7.0,5.0,8,2019
Shanese ,Some things seem off .,"  I ordered the yellow (beautiful , bright color by the way) ! The shoe itself fits PERFECTLY!! I ordered my regular size and the fit is right on. My only concern is (after reading previous reviews about counterfeit shoes) after comparing them to my other CROCS (whom I know for a fact are authentic) , things does seem a little off. I‚Äôm not sure if it means anything . But my other crocs read ‚ÄúMade in Vietnam‚Äù and these read ‚ÄúMade in China‚Äù ... which has me a little confused. Again , IT MAY BE NOTHING !! I just had to point out that fact . Which that may be why these looks a little cheaper than my originals . They look kinda like they were RUSHED on the assembly line when you‚Äôre looking at them closely  . Other than this . They‚Äôre great ! Great color , size , fit . I‚Äôm definitely gonna keep them !",4, Lemon,10.0,8.0,6,2020
Alex D,"Caved and bought a pair. After this review, you will to","  Anyone going on deployment needs Crocs, so I got these for $30ish. They came in a plastic Crocs bag in new condition. I put them on and immediately felt weird, but you eventually get over your loss of dignity, as everyone else owns a pair. When they‚Äôre new, they have these nubs that you put your feet onto that stab you with every step, but in a good way. Every other shoe brand says I‚Äôm a 9M, but Crocs think I‚Äôm a 10M, so make sure you get a size up for anything from this brand. There is no slip resistance, so watch yourself in the shower. The Off-road ankle strap seems durable and the whole shoe feels like it will hold up to any challenge. The top is flexible and will stretch.",5, Black,12.0,10.0,4,2020
A,Perfect! Order up a size; especially if you wear a half size!,"  *I bought the charms separately on amazon; highly recommend(never too old for charms!!)**I normally wear a size women‚Äôs 9 (sometimes 9.5) but I bought a size 10. I ALWAYS recommend going up a size in crocs. These are not sneakers that need to be snug. You don‚Äôt want these to be tight at all! These are relaxing shoes. If they are snug, your feet will rub, get smelly, and create sores from the rubbing. And my foot just barely hangs over the edge when I bought a size 9 a while ago.They have a strap on the back to help keep your feet in place (I call that putting them in 4 wheel drive), or you can flip the strap to the front (shown in my picture). I prefer it that way because it‚Äôs easy to slide on and off like slippers.I personally wear this pair to work.I bought different colors for day to day wear.They are SUPER easy to clean! I typically use a disinfectant wipe; but you can use all purpose cleaner a towel, spray Lysol, wash them in the sink with dish soap, etc. But do NOT use bleach!",5, Slate Grey,10.0,8.0,3,2020
MIGirl,Surprisingly Great,"  I didn‚Äôt want to love Crocs. They are so boxy and ugly, but that ugliness grew on me really fast once I started wearing them. I bought them because I needed gardening shoes. My other shoes were constantly having soil and other yard debris packed into the treads and it was way too much work to clean them out. So, I decided to give a pair of Crocs a try since with the holes they should get decent airflow and I could hose them off or toss them in the washing machine as needed. So, I reluctantly bought a pair of very purple Crocs.After a week of wearing my new Crocs, I can say I totally get why people love these things.They have NO arch support, which for me is generally horrible but they‚Äôre so roomy that it‚Äôs more like walking barefoot than it is like wearing bad shoes.With as roomy as they are, not at all form fitting, you‚Äôd think your feet would slip and slide all over the place and you‚Äôd have to work to keep them on your feet. But they don‚Äôt. My feet stay in place and the Crocs stay on my feet just fine.Nothing sticks to them. Dirt and soil get in through the holes, but also go right back out through the holes, just leaving behind dirty feet. And nothing has stuck to the treads: dirt, soil, mud, dog poop, compost‚Ä¶ nothin‚Äô. They also don‚Äôt stay wet long at all. I had to go out in the pouring rain and they were dry by the time I walked through my house.And, with all the holes, there‚Äôs great air circulation, just about as good as sandals. This was my first pair of Crocs; I doubt it will be my last. They‚Äôre too comfortable and convenient not to love them.",5, Neon Purple,8.0,6.0,4,2020
Chazman1946,"Great, love them.","  This is the second pair of Crocs I bought in the last month. Never owned a pair and always thought they looked ugly, and never understood why there was this attraction to them.I have wide feet, 12 4E, I was skeptical the 12 M size was going to be too tight.  They fit perfectly, I guess because they are wide to start off with, although if I had narrow feet I probably wouldn't be too happy with them.The things are super comfortable and around the house, I wear them with strap up front so I can just slip them off and on like a pair of slippers.  When I go out I wear the strap in the rear to secure them completely on my feet.They may not be the most beautiful pair of footwear, but I have worn them out dancing, even playing golf. They're great, that's why I bought this second pair.I was also skeptical about the little knobs on the inside of the shoe, but these I found kind of massage your feet and make them feel good.",5, Cobblestone,14.0,12.0,5,2019
Aurora,"Raised letters that say Hecho in Mexico on strap hurt the backs of my feet, this is new","  I have been wearing crocs for years. I have had many pairs of this kind that I ordered. However, this time I bought them, I put them on, and wore them for a few hours. And I was like why are the backs of my ankles hurting? It felt like something was rubbing the backs of my ankles. I tried to ignore it, but ultimately I became worried it was going to rub the skin off my ankles so I took the shoes off and looked at them. The reason why the strap hurts is because it says ""Hecho in Mexico"" in RAISED lettering!! The letters on the inside of the strap are raised and keep rubbing the backs of my ankles as I walk. So I have concluded that the only way to wear these shoes safely is to move the strap from the back ankle area to the top of the shoe, which I don't like. Why did you have to do this, Crocs??? Please stop putting the raised letters of Hecho in Mexico on the inside strap because it hurts my skin. I want Crocs to stop making the shoes like this, because it sucks if my shoes hurt because of this. Why?? Please remove this lettering off the inside straps because you're causing pain to your customers.",4, Black,9.0,7.0,3,2020
Lauren Cosgrove,13 year journey from 2007 to 2020 achievement unlocked,"  In 2007 I really wanted a pair of crocs but we couldn‚Äôt afford the name brand so I got purple air walks instead. Most of my life has been that Clover Valley or Great Value edition. Flash forward to 2020, I bought my first pair of crocs in my mid twenties. I‚Äôve been preparing 13 years to experience this moment. Do I have regrets for purchasing hole shoes? Probably. Do I have an insane amount of air flow for my toes? Most definitely.

Doreen,Perfect for Disney!,"  Love these crocs!!  Family planned a vacation to Disney and we heard that to avoid blisters we should purchase a pair of crocs.  Needless to say, they saved our vacation.  I wore nothing but the cros while we were there.  I didn't want to take the chance of getting blisters walking 25,000 steps a day for 10 days.  They are quick and easy to dry after getting wet, can be worn with or without short socks, are very comfortable to walk in, cushioned and arch support.  Toe width has enough room for comfortable spread with no rubbing on sides or top of toes.  I wouldn't recommend any other shoe for Disney or for sore tired feet.  Just love them!",5, White,9.0,7.0,7,2019
Hannah Lynn,Not the nicest looking shoe but the most comfy.,"  As much as I'd love brown leather wingtip oxfords, they're impossible to find in womens size 5/6 in Wide Width. or anything nice looking for that matter. and I got tired of looking. When you have Cerebral Palsy, dressing is a struggle. I got to a point where I wanted something that I could put on without help, and comfortable with or without socks. Are they kinda ugly? Yeah. But it's worth it. I plan on getting two in black so they can blend in with my pants, but sometimes I enjoy colors. So far I own a Slate Grey and Navy. Both pairs were the right size (I ended up getting Womens 6. A little roomy but not too much, and i have tiny feet) Obviously they're snugger when I wear them with fuzzy socks.  These shoes are also great toe box wise. My heel is very narrow and my foot widens up to my toe box. The toe box is wide enough to where I don't feel squeezed at all, even with thick socks.When I'm travelling and the hotel doesn't have a shower seat I can wear these in the shower since I can't go barefoot. They are very easy to rinse out and dry.Even with my issue with dragging my left big toe, they're pretty sturdy. Most shoes after half a year would already have a hole and need to be replaced. I plan on getting second pairs just to have just in case, but I don't think my left shoes will wear through soon. They're not extremely supportive, I wouldn't recommend them for running, but as someone with chronic pain and weak ankle/foot muscles, these are great for around the house and walking through a bookstore.",5, Slate Grey,6.0,4.0,4,2019
K. Cunningham,Decent support for around the house,"  I got these on a friend's recommendation after avoiding Crocs for years. I never understood what the hype was before, but my friend insisted that if I wanted something to support my feet while doing things around the house, these would be a good choice. I am glad I gave them a chance, and am now debating on getting a second pair for wearing out.While the arch support isn't spectacular, it's a massive step up from trying to shove insoles into slippers like I was doing before. They hold their shape well so far, they fit comfortably, have a little bit of shock absorption to them, and best of all they are EASY TO CLEAN! Also if you're a bit clumsy like me, the roomy toe area makes a great buffer to prevent you from injuring yourself by stubbing your toes.They fit very well without being too tight, and stay on my feet with or without the heel strap, so I've taken to keeping the strap folded up over the front to get in and out of them more easily.I'm definitely a fan now that I've tried them.",5, Ice Blue,7.0,5.0,2,2020
Shelby White,Perfect for everyday wear!,"  As strange as crocs look, they sure are comfortable. I wear these bad boys every single day. If I know I‚Äôll be walking a lot, I‚Äôll pull the heel strap back and kick them into 4WD. 100% worth buying.On a serious note, I love my crocs. Perfect for every day wear, and even better to wear at the beach. The holes around the toes allow a lot of ventilation, and easy to shake out the sand.They‚Äôre lightweight and extremely easy to clean. They are also able to withstand different environments, whether you‚Äôre walking on sharp surfaces such as rocks or glass. I‚Äôve also tested them on slippery surfaces, surprisingly haven‚Äôt fallen yet!I get a lot of compliments on my crocs, especially when I‚Äôm wearing my scrubs.

Sprinks&Bell,Order a size down if you like a normal non-loose fit...,"  Overall, I've been very happy with my Classic Crocs.  I wear a size 7.5 shoe and I own several pairs of Croc Flip-Flops/Sandals which I ordered in a size 8 (happy I did for those).  However, many have said the Classic Clogs run large.  After sizing my foot according to the chart it still said for me to order a size 8.  I went against that and ordered a size 7 based on the reviews saying they run large.  I'm so glad I ordered down a size! They fit how my normal shoe would because I do not like any loose feeling when I'm walking.  Even with my socks on they fit great and are surprisingly comfortable.  I can walk long distances without any foot fatigue.  Only minor negative I would say is my feet get warm in them.  I don't notice it until I sit down when having them on.  Other than that I'll definitely be purchasing additional pairs and love how easy they are to clean!",5, Neo Mint,7.0,5.0,2,2020
Synthia,Heavenly Feel. Massages the soles of my feet and keeps them from itching.,"  My first pair of Crocs just arrived and after wearing them one day, I am in love!I got these shoes because my feet itch in other shoes during the summer time. The cloth interior  of regular shoes trap sweat and bacteria. It  is just not sanitary.I can wash, wipe and sanitize the inside of my Crocs every day if I want in order to avoid that issue.I intend to wear these barefoot, outside, after the shower and anytime I want because I can still keep them sanitary.Now, for the feel: Ooh, la la! I love the textured insides. The little raised bumps and spikes inside the shoes poke the bottom of my feet, giving them a massage and relieving tension when I walk. This feels so good!Often my feet are tired and stressed and I have to press them against something or do exercises to relieve them. But now, Crocs can destress my feet for me while I walk.Also, I like that I can wear the straps over the top of my feet like a slide-in slipper or behind my heel . It's so convenient to have two types of styles.  When I put the straps behind my heel, I can feel the spikes inside the shoes better so that is my preferred style after a long day.These shoes are very roomy. At first I thought they were too wide, but I like that there's so much room.The only concern was that one strap is a little looser than the other. Since most factories have standardization, I questioned whether I was sent a knock-off or the real thing. I hope these are real. Either way, they feel super good and I intend to get several pair.Now, let me get off the internet and go walk in my Crocs because my feet want to play!",5, Black,8.0,6.0,1,2020
konmarikhadija,Roomy Fit,  It doesn't say so on the description here but these crocs are labeled as 'Roomy Fit' so they are huge.  It's a little weird but it seems like Crocs fit differently depending on where they are made. I'm a 7.5 and initially opted for a 5/7 but found that it was too tight for my toes when I put the strap on the back of my heel. This was on a pair made in Mexico. However I have a 5/7 that was made in Vietnam that fit fine with or without the strap. So for this one I decided to order a size up to make sure that it will be comfortable no matter where it was made. The pair I received was made in Vietnam but since they are 'Roomy Fit' they are way too big. The color is gorgeous so I'm going to return these and order my regular size again and hope for the best.Update:I received the 5/7 today and they‚Äôre perfect! Leaving the review at 4 stars because it really should be in the description that these are roomy fit.,4, Black,8.0,6.0,2,2020
ResearchAddict,My go-to comfy shoes,"  Crocs were born in my hometown, well the town I lived in the longest, I should say. At first, I thought they looked hideous, kinda still do, to be honest. They make people's feet look huge. Yet, when I tried a pair at my daughter's house, because she insisted it was like walking on clouds, and I had a very sore, broken foot, I couldn't believe how comfortable they were. I began to sing a new tune! I became all about comfortable shoes. And this ics coming from a woman who's family owned several chains of shoes stores for 77 years! High-end fashion shoes, mid-range casual boots and shoes, and lower end shoes too. We never had anything like these in our stores though (they hadn't been invented yet). We did sell Jellies (remember those?) in the summer in the low-priced shops, but Crocs are so much nicer.I have owned and worn out 5 pairs of the classic Crocs in various colors, as well as 2 pairs of the winter lined ones. I just bought more classics, in more colors, because why not wear comfy shoes? I wear them gardening and when I'm being super casual. I keep a couple pairs as indoor slippers too. Will have to order a new pair for winter soon.",5, Grass Green,6.0,4.0,1,2020
Amazon Customer,Good Buy!,"  A little about me so you can categorize my review:  I live in Hawaii where Crocs and Bermuda shorts are de rigueur.  I wear dress shoes at weddings and restaurants, but I have seen people wear them there without being asked to leave.I go through about 2 pairs a year (yes, Hawaii, ha ha).I actually expected to buy a pair at our local slipper shop where I normally get them, but I was shocked to find they had gone to $45/pair!  I whipped out my phone & showed the lady they are $26 on Amazon.  She smiled and said she would help me find a good fit so I could order from Amazon (Hawaii has pretty girls with pretty manners).I was apprehensive because of other reviews, but my pair fit as well as any, and the rubber seemed about average.  The toe box and width were a little more generous and the arch support was a little flatter, but overall, fit is as expected.  The tread on the new Crocs is more robust.  That is a plus for Hawaii because it rains everyday here, and slippery footwear are dangerous, especially on steps, sidewalks, and roads without dedicated walking paths.  My previous pairs were made in Mexico; these were made in China.  (Maybe these were made more with Haole feet in mind.)  The pic shows my existing (Mexico) Croc on the left, and the new (China) Croc on the right.Good: price, fit, wear, appearanceBad: (none)Summary: II like them. I am going to order another pair for our other house.-Larry",5, Black,10.0,8.0,1,2020
L. M. Whitney,WOW,"  For the last 4 years my feet have been blistered, over callused and in severe pain by the end of my shifts! This was to the point that I almost decided NOTHING would help and that after 40 years on my feet in the restaurant industry, I was destined  to a future of crippling pain. Everyone was telling me that Crocs were that answer but, I was thinking how could a shoe for such a little price help my feet? After all I had spent hundreds on different shoes throughout the last four years... Finally I caved and figured at the price, I could just throw them away like the rest of the EXPENSIVE shoes I had purchased. Let me tell you what a glorious feeling right from the start!!! My feet and back no longer hurt even after 8 - 10 hour shifts! They feel like wearing nothing at all, so naturel and comfy! Do your self a favor and try Crocs!!!",5, Black,17.0,15.0,3,2019

dasn0wman,Awesome,"  These guys are amazing.  For years, I avoided them despite of the hype some time ago.  The funny thing is that I was always looking for a shoe that can work as a slipper because that would be so practical for traveling.The regular clogs don‚Äôt have enough backing on the heel to be a shoe.  I got these slippers once and tried to use them as shoes but they have no soles and so very uncomfortable to walk on hard surfaces and got really wet when it was raining.  The soft shoes have too much backing on the heel and so cannot be used as a slipper.Enter the Croc‚Äôs innovative design that has a movable heel strap so it‚Äôs a slipper when you‚Äôre at home and a shoe when you‚Äôre moving around.In the picture, they look solid so you know they will work on hard surfaces.  My concern was if they are comfortable because it looks like hard plastic but it is really some rubber or silicone material so quite soft and comfy.The only thing is the sizing is off.  I wear 9.5 and got a 10 but I should have gotten a 9.  It is loose but not really an issue except if you plan to drive wearing them.  I have a manual car and I stalled the car when I drove it wearing these for first time.I don‚Äôt think looks is a problem and very subjective.  In this case, they become so iconically ugly that many ppl think they‚Äôre beautiful now.",5, Chocolate,12.0,10.0,5,2018
Amazon Customer,Yes.,"  I'm a pretty average looking dude, but now that I have these Crocs‚Ñ¢ I am easily the sexiest person I know.Seriously though --  they are convenient, they are comfortable, and they are awesome.  My wife hates them, but I just can't give them up.  They are the fanny pack of shoes: crazy convenient, but everybody makes fun of them for some reason.  Don't care.  I'm a middle-aged fat guy with three kids.  I don't have to care about that stuff any more and that's freaking rad.  Wear these Crocs‚Ñ¢ and be awesome like me.[I know the product description says ""Women's Crocs"" but they are being worn by a dude just fine. No idea what that's all about.]",5, Black,14.0,12.0,2,2020
doug p,Never bought Crocs  befroe they are worth the money,  Was looking for a new pair of Crocs to replace my older pair and after going to the outlet store and finding nothing i decided to just order them from amazon found the style i liked and a color and they had them in my size ordered them i have had other pairs of Crocs in the past and knew what i was getting so didn't think twice about not getting them after the first week of getting a new pair of Crocs and telling myself im going to keep them i take and remove the straps and side buttons to get them to fit the way i like them and they are mostly my house shoes and as of lately i take them to work and switch out of my work shoes and into them for the drive home overall they are comfortable to wear the colors pop and they are true to size and you dont have to go up a size which is what i do when i am looking for regular shoes but not with Crocs they fit right and i love the feel,5, Bright Cobalt,14.0,12.0,1,2020
T.H.,"OMG, I am now a total Crocs Convert !!!","  A friend bought me a pair, and I was HOOKED.  So I ordered this pair via Amazon in the Ice Blue color, in my normal sneaker-size women's US 7.  They fit true to size.  I'm so glad I discovered Crocs...  They are so comfy, light & airy, with great cushioning for walking all day long.  I used to think they were just plastic gardening shoes, or just comfy clogs for nurses & doctors.  But NOW I am seeing Crocs everywhere.... They have become a highly sought-after fashion item!  I also ordered the medium pink color (via Amazon), so now I have 3 pair of Crocs.  The bright fun colors make me smile, they are actually ""in fashion"" right now, and my feet couldn't be happier.PS... I advise to google them & check out the prices from various department stores, shoes stores, etc, & compare those prices with Amazon's pricing.  Although I must say this seller shipped pretty fast, had a competitive price, AND has the largest assortment of colors to choose from!  Great purchase.  -- Thank you :)",5, Ice Blue,7.0,5.0,1,2020
ajk170,Needs a little break in time to get a great fit!,"  Ok, so I never thought I would wear Crocs but after years and years of hype through movies, online, word of mouth, internet, and personal friends, I figure I'd try them.  And they were all correct! These really are great feeling things for my feet.  They aren't cool looking (at least not for an American non-hipster male) but boy are the nice feeling and functional. Specifically on function, I was looking for a camp slipper that I could slip on around the campsite/RV/Campground/lodge/cabin and walk outside without putting on boots or sneakers.  Sandals are ok if you're a boy or when on an island beach but anywhere else, nope.  Moccasins are ok, but typically they do not have a hard sole.  So camp slippers with hard soles are becoming a thing but they are typically over $80 and at that point they are just a really cheap boot.  So Crocs help fill the void and niche for a camp slipper.  Of course, Crocs are not insulated but inside I usually have socks on so these are perfect, esp in non cold months or climates because with socks or no socks I can slip the feet right into these things. And so far, without socks these things do not make the feet hot (at least not mine) so not a lot of foot sweat and the resulting stink.  What I have learned is that these things do stretch, at least a little which is good.  I ordered a size 9 ( i wear a 9.5 in boots/drewss shoes [Danner, Allen Edmonds, Sperry) and tennis shoes are a 10 [Nike, Adddis, Chucks]) and when they first arrived, the left one fit perfectly but the right one seemed a tad small since a couple of my toes were just barely bumping up against the front of the croc.  Plus I kinda thought my heals were right on the back edge of the croc but despite this , they were still pretty comfy but not great. Plus,the first few days of ownership and wearing without socks, the tops and sides of my feet were getting a few hot spots from rubbing. But nonetheless,  I continued to wear them and powered through hoping they would get better and rather quickly (within a couple weeks) with casual wearing these feel better (my right toes no longer barely touches the front and no hot spots) but I still feel like my heels are on the back edges of the crocks so I think they maybe too short.  But I really like that they fit snug and never feel like a flip-flop that could slide right off my feet, even when barefoot in them. Plus the nubs have a great massaging effect - super sensitive feet may not like it but the nubs are soft and with socks i can't feel them. But because of how good these feel, I want to believe the size 10 will feel better and as a result I have a size 10 on the way.If you can find these in the store, I would try on several pairs of the same size just to see if they fit slightly different due to variances in the QA/QC.  I think a person would be able to find the perfect fit in the store, esp. if they are between sizes like I am.  if my size 9 were just a tad larger they would be perfect.  As it is, I'm expecting the size 10 to be a little too big and slip around but I'm hoping they will work and not slide around but I expect them to feel just a little bit better, otherwise I'll stick to the smaller size due to a potentially better fit.",5, Navy,11.0,9.0,0,2020

HonestGuy3017,"Better Than My Old Ones, But....","  These are the genuine Crocs clogs, and are better than my old ones, which I purchased at a famous discount store chain. (Take a look at my photos.  Depending on what device you are using, the photos will show up in a different order.  I have two photos of the Crocs by themselves; one shows the excellent tread on the sole, and the other shows the bumps/points inside.  Two photos show the Crocs side-by-side with my old worn-out store brand clogs.)  But the Crocs are not an entirely unmixed blessing!  First, the Crocs cost over 3x the price of the chain store clogs.  Winner: chain store clogs.  Second, the Crocs are made in Vietnam,  while the chain store ones are made in USA. BIG win for the chain store clogs!  But the Crocs have advantages, too.  First, the Crocs fit as advertised. If you wear a size 11, order a size 11. (These do not come in Wide width. If you need a wider width, consider ordering the next 1/2 size up.  For instance, I wear a men's 10-1/2 Wide in a regular shoe. I ordered these Crocs in men's size 11, and they fit perfectly.)  The chain store clogs run small, so I had to get a size 12 of them. Winner: Crocs. Second, the Crocs sole has better tread and therefore better traction.  (See photos.)  Winner: Crocs. Third, the Crocs come with a strap that you can put around your heel to keep them from slipping off (see photos again).  If you don't want to use the straps, simply fold them up over the front, out of the way.  Winner: Crocs.  Fourth, Crocs have little buttons (or points) molded into the insole that massage the soles of your feet. This may or may not be an advantage, depending on your preference. Hint: if the points bother you, try wearing socks, or thicker socks if you're already using socks. For me, the points only took about 20 minutes of walking to get used to.  NO clear winner here; which is best depends upon your preference.  The Crocs appear well made, fit well, and are very comfortable. The next question for me is, will they outlast my chain store clogs long enough to justify spending more than three times as much money, for a foreign-made product?  The main reasons I bought these are: 1.  I could not get clogs in black anymore from the chain store.  They only come in an ugly brownish-green color that is patterned to look like dead leaves! (If you are a gardener who wants your shoes to blend in with your mulch, you might prefer the chain store clogs. Me, not so much!);  and 2.  I have always wanted to try the genuine Crocs product.  Time will tell whether they were worth the extra investment.",4, Black,13.0,11.0,0,2020

I needed some comfy shoes to wear around the house and to the lake for boating/other activities where i could get my shoes wet and not sweat it. I used to wear these bad boys in high school non-stop (yep, you guessed it...graduated a virgin, but things took a turn for the better quickly after - MOVING ON! lol). Amazon was the only place that carried a 14 like my gargantuan feet need....so i copped em up on wardrobe, just because i was skeptical about falling back in to my old ways. Oh you best believe, the second i put them on i ripped up that return label! Who could deny their ugly, all-day comfort and goodness?!?! Long story, short....haven't stopped wearing them since. They gone from ""around the house and on the boat only"" shoes to ""fine dining, church, barbeque, errands, anywhere that would make my wife embarrassed to be with me, etc."" shoes.

I never thought I'd like Crocs, but OMG they are so comfy & so cute... I have officially fallen in love with Crocs!  I wear a women's size 7 in sneakers, so that's the size I buy in Crocs, and they fit me perfectly.  I have looked at the Crocs in the shoe stores, and these Crocs from Amazon are indeed the real deal -- and the price is the same on Amazon (sometimes even lower).... plus Amazon usually has a much better selection in available colors, too.  ------  I live in S Florida where it's almost always hot and humid, so my feet love the air conditioned holes in these shoes.  I have loads of sneakers, dressy shoes, and flip flops. But some days you just wanna wear something totally cute & colorful, and comfy.  -----  Btw...  I've noticed that Crocs have become VERY fashionable & ""on trend"" lately.  I see teenage girls & grown women rockin' them in all sorts of colors.  I'm really enjoying them, and so are my grateful feet.  I can wear them 24/7 and be so comfortable.  I've gotten so many compliments on the Lemon Yellow ones already, and that's from teens to women in their 30's, 40's, 50's and up!  Apparently everyone wants to own a cute pair of colorful Crocs these days.  --- This vendor mailed mine in a hurry & they arrived fast.  I definitely recommend Crocs, and this vendor on Amazon!

Hippy Woman,Great Shoe,"  I‚Äôm a size 7.5. The 8 is too big. The 7 had to be broken in for 2 weeks, because it was definitely a bit small at first and the outer edge almost touched the back of my foot.But here‚Äôs the thing about Crocs. If you get them too big, the arch support won‚Äôt work. Your foot isn‚Äôt supposed to swim in these. It‚Äôs definitely up to the user to decide their fit preference.As for my opinion: If you want a bigger fit, go a size (or in my case, a half-size) up.If you want a more ‚Äúcustom‚Äù fit, order true to size (or in my case, a half-size down) and break them in. The rubber loosens up a bit and conforms to your foot.I do think that this model of Crocs has gotten progressively smaller in fit over the past 4 years. So the Crocs of old are a darn sight bigger than today‚Äôs sizes.I have wide, duck feet, and the normal width was fine for me.The interior rubber ‚Äúspikes‚Äù inside have also gotten stronger and more effective. So much that it did take me a few weeks to break them in, because the spikes were QUITE spikey for my taste. It calms down after some wear.My husband couldn‚Äôt handle the spikes because he has soft feet with zero callus (lucky duck). So if you have sensitive feet, these might need to be worn with some socks until things soften up.",4, Slate Grey,8.0,6.0,0,2020

I typically wear a 10.5 men‚Äôs, but usually need a wide size. I ordered the 10 size and these are a very comfortable fit. Plenty of room, without feeling too loose or like they‚Äôre going to fall off my feet.I wear these around the house for added support, and will wear them out fishing when the weather gets warmer.Tip: I have worn them with some thin socks and I find that keeps my meet foot bottom from getting sweaty in them.",5, Khaki,12.0,10.0,1,2020

It is no secret that for years crocs have been violated for being big and a but um, unique to say the least but these shoes are super super comfortable! Staying home I realized my chanclas were not making the cut and decided to shop for new stay at home footwear, leading me to buying crocs. The ones in the video are ice blue, they are beautiful and comfortable! As someone with arched feet, you will not go wrong with purchasing these. After wearing them relentlessly for weeks it was super noticeable just how unsupportive other brands are with feet arches. Crocs though, they've got your back. They are of a rubbery plastic, so your feet will sweat at first, but after a while, at least for me, they'll stopped sweating. Overall this was worth the purchase since they serve as stay at home, out door and water shoes. They are true to size, however, you may consider sizing up if you want them to be roomy. Overall they're good. (as a size reference I used my Nike slides), I hope this helps!",5, Ice Blue,8.0,6.0,1,2020

I can wear them with or without socks. When I want to go out to the shed outside or to the mailbox I just throw these on. If it's rainy outside, no prob!

Also good for Hawaii because everyone takes their shoes of to go indoors - they slip on easily.  Not super comfortable, as people often say of Crocs, and not very supportive at all.  I might think of buying these again to wear in Chicago, because of ease of use, but not sure.  If you wear an 8 or 8.5, I'd definitely suggest following other reviewer's recommendations, and sizing up.  A 9 worked perfectly for me, but at first even the 9 felt a tiny bit short.

Laverne Otto-Phitre,Great deal on an extremely practical piece of ugly footwear!,"  Rare to find this brand at the Amazon price I paid - wanted a clog with heel strap so I could safely drive back & forth to the local aquatic center.  I wasn't excited about the glossy black appearance, but since I only wear them to drive from my garage to the pool, walk about 200 feet across hot concrete, stick them in a locker while I swim, then reverse the process to go home, I can overlook my own fashion faux pas.  The heel strap keeps them properly positioned on my feet while driving, and the drain holes in the toes make them great for poolside.  I have falling arches & these make the walk from car to poolside & back so much less painful than foam flip-flops - and as stated before, I feel confident driving my car (automatic transmission) whereas with flip-flops, I'd change in & out of socks & shoes, while my kids wait for me to get the car started & the A/C going.  If these last half as long as my old Crocs Mammoth clogs (10+ years so far & still have a little bit of tread on the soles), then these are the best deal in footwear for my Fashion Tone-Deaf Curmudgeon Community.

Emma,the perfect shoe,"  Who could say anything bad about a croc? It's one of those shoes where I feel like a significant number of people know what size they are in crocs, but just in case: I am usually between an 8-9 in shoes. These run about half a size larger, although I can wear both an 8 and a 9 in crocs, I like the way the 8 looks better. If you have wide feet and that's a deciding factor for you in getting the larger sizes, you don't have to worry about that because of the wideness of crocs. I'm so glad these are back in style. The white ones especially are a perfect staple shoe for summer. I wouldn't hike in them, but they would be fine as an everyday shoe for sure. They also make a good house slipper for going inside and outside too. we stan",5, White,8.0,6.0,1,2020

I can wear them out to the garden and then just hose them off. They're quiet enough to wear around the house while the kids are sleeping.

I am outdoors working in the yard many hours per day and my pale skin was cooking in my regular uncomfortable $4 flip flops. That, and needing arch support, my feet were aching. Now, my gorgeous grass green crocs protect my fragile skin. The crocs are SO comfy and sturdy I've begun wearing them on the regular for NON outdoor gardening and pool cleaning activities.

Tee H,Must Buy!,"  I was pretty skeptical about purchasing this shoe, due to the conflicting opinions in fashion.  What is more important, style or comfort?  Well, if you were to ask me that question two weeks ago, my answer would be style without a bit of hesitation.  However, after working eight-plus hour shifts, five days a week, standing only, my mindset ‚Äì and answer to that question ‚Äì has definitely changed.  I thought my Nike sneakers would cut it, but I soon realized they provided no support, no natural curvature for the foot to follow, no air circulation.  My knees and feet began to kill, and I decided it might be a good idea to do some research.Clogs.  Clogs?  I know I wanted more practical shoes, but clogs are just not suited for my nineteen-year-old self.  I mean, I still wanted something relatively cute.  But was that possible?  I kept scrolling through the shopping tab of Google, until I saw this pair of crocs.  Now, I remember I sported a bright orange pair in middle school, but I think I outgrew that stage.  Wait, they have a white pair.  Much more mature color.  I decided to take the risk, after all, my I owed it to my feet.Not only did these crocs pull my whole scrub uniform together ‚Äì I mean what screams healthcare more than scrubs and crocs? ‚Äì but I managed an entire shift with 99% less foot and knee pain than my previous sneakers had caused.  Another plus, they are ‚Äúnot only the most comfortable shoes, but also easy to clean just using soap and water and allowing for a quick dry.‚Äù  Because one of my duties as a pharmacy technician is to pour liquids, it is easy to spill on your shoes.  But, because of the synthetic material, I am able to grab a wet paper towel and wipe the mess right off.  But wait, there‚Äôs more.  I‚Äôm sure everyone can relate to their feet getting sweaty in sneakers, especially if you are moving around all day.  Well, crocs solve that problem for you.  The holes provide circulation and leave your feet as dry as ever.I totally agree with and support this review!‚ÄúThere is a moderate arch support. I have low arches and my sister-in-law has extremely high arches; neither of us feel like more support is needed‚Äù As arch support was one of my main concerns, I can assure that crocs also leave me feeling like my feet are supported properly. I highly recommend purchasing this product, as it has changed my work day experience.  I no longer suffer with severe feet and joint pain that is caused by flat shoes.  These crocs provide just the right amount of support and maintain comfort with the foamy cushion.

Nina Jordan,"Excellent for pool deck, locker room, and at home!  Good arch support.","  Excellent sandal for walking on the pool deck and in locker rooms!  Good arch support!  Very comfortable. Easy to slip on and off while standing. Nice big toe box. I also wear them at home as slippers, as shoes in warm weather, on grass, on docks, and for canoeing, and kayaking. Lift your foot up and the water drains, out so your feet do not stay wet. On colder days I wear them with socks. I have worn them for many years and I keep buying more of same. Their usefulness and comfort wins out over lack of beauty due to bulky look. I hope they keep making this same classic sandal.  I have to replace them because extended wear on the pool deck concrete smooths the bottom making them slippery. Otherwise they last a long time. I wear them 5 or 6 days a week for hours at the pool while teaching swimming, life-guarding, roving, and while showering in locker room after swimming.",5, Black,9.0,7.0,2,2020
Rachel,I LOVE MY CROCS.,"  I was so excited to get the cyan blue crocs on super sale. These are the comfiest shoes ever. The dots on the soles massage your feet, they provide great arch support, they‚Äôre such a cute color, and it‚Äôs finally long enough past the initial croc trend that they‚Äôre ironically stylish again. 10/10 recommend for beach days, days at the pool, rainy days, regular days, lazy days, winter days with socks, or whatever else to want to wear them with. They definitely run large, so try on a friend‚Äôs or try them on in the store first if possible. But snag yourself a pair, you won‚Äôt regret it!",5, Ice Blue,6.0,4.0,4,2018
AndieJoy,Perfect in every way,"  I needed some slip-on shoes to wear while working in my garage (woodworking).  I don‚Äôt have a lot of shoes because I have long, wide feet and I have trouble finding ones with a comfortable fit. I had been wearing my work tennis in the garage, but then while I was at my job I would look down and notice sawdust under the laces lol. So, I ordered these and they are really perfect:Easy to slip on and off.Durable.Super lightweight.Waterproof. I can hose them off.And so comfortable! I forget that I‚Äôm wearing them. I‚Äôve actually finished shopping before and then realized that I went to the store in my garage Crocs lol.I have huge feet and I wear size 11 in all shoe styles so that‚Äôs what I got for these. They are a bit roomy in the width and length, but they still don‚Äôt seem bulky when they‚Äôre on, my foot does not slide around inside the shoes, and it means I can wear my thick comfy socks under them!I want more! Maybe one pair for working out in the yard. And maybe some lined ones to use as slippers. I definitely want some in cooler colors next!",5, Black,11.0,9.0,1,2019
Jake Weber,2020 should be filled with Crocs.,"  Ok so I've had a pair for myself and bought pairs for friends they run big & they are actually awesome but the ""melon"" color looks yellow & its lime green. Not even close to the picture. so bad because of that. It's important to represent accurate description & photos for each.But let's talk about how much puss you'll get with these. If you think these are ugly or bad it's because you ain't got fashion or game. Overall I've bought 8 for different friends and now they are drippin in the streets. If you want a girl to recognize you toss those flowers & buy some crocs. If she doesn't want to be your wife after that then she ain't the one mister. If 2020 wasn't the year of Corona it'd be the year of crocs. Trust. Don't sleep.",5, Citrus,8.0,6.0,1,2020
S. Petty,These are now my favorite kick-around shoe - even went shopping in Walmart with them and they turned out to be comfy.,"  Where have these been all my life?  I first discovered a cheap copy of these at Walmart, and I loved how they fit and how easily they slip on and off.  So I was pleased to find the original brand here on Amazon.  I live in the desert, and our home is kept on the warm side too, so I definitely need models (like this classic model) with the holes in the side and top - the one thing I didn't like about my cheap knock-offs is they didn't have those holes, and my feet (with or without socks) were uncomfortably hot and clammy inside the house.  Another good feature is being able to toss the shoes into a bucket of soapy water to clean them after slogging in the mud outside.For me, the strap is crucial.  If I fold the strap up to the front out of the way, my heel sometimes slips out over the back end of the shoe, so I hope they never eliminate the strap!My feet are 11 1/2, and very wide (12 4E New Balance 408s fit well), and the size 12 Crocs fit good - I am going to try a size 13 next for kicking around the house and see if they are even easier to slip on/off.",5, Black,14.0,12.0,8,2016
Martian263,who would have thought it.,"  I know what you're thinking, these things are ugly and look ridiculous, and you're not wrong. What grown man would wear these. Well, turns out, this grown man would. When these things first hit the market, I was with everyone else making fun of them. But here's the thing, my brother is a cook, on his feet all day, and he wears crocks for cooks (don't worry, they're different than these, not open, so no foot fungus in your food) and he convinced me to try them because he swore they were the most comfortable pair of shoes he's ever had. So I finally broke down and bought a pair, and you know what, he was right. These things are great. I slip them on when I've got errands to run, light yard work, or sometimes when it's nice, just out and about, and they are very comfortable, and durable too. Get em wet, no problem, wear them with or without socks, still comfortable. Yes I look like a goof with them on, and I thought that would bother me, but it turns out my sense of shame is way lessened by how comfortable they are. If I thought I could get away with it, I'd wear them everywhere during the warmer months.",5, Black,13.0,6.0,0,2019
Alex,"Just do it, they‚Äôre pretty dang comfortable.",  So I‚Äôll admit I always felt crocs were ugly & ridiculous. I thought no matter how comfortable they may be it just wasn‚Äôt worth stooping to that level... but then I reached the age where comfort & convenience became more important than vanity. I needed something to wear during the summer that he slightly more protection from itchy grass than flip flops but was cooler & didn‚Äôt require socks like tennis shoes so I caved and bought these crocs. Vowing to never wear them in public.Well I‚Äôm here to say I freakin‚Äô love these shoes. They‚Äôre comfy and surprisingly durable. They have enough support that my feet aren‚Äôt sore at the end of the day even after walking all over our property doing chores. They exceeded my expectations and I will probably buy another pair when I wear these out. But just for the record still not wearing them to town.,5, Khaki,8.0,6.0,1,2019
Cinderella 111,Better than flip flops in the garden!,"  I'm a old lady, concerned about falling or slipping outside working on my farm.  I have been told to buy Crocs for years, but as usual, I'm the last one to catch trends.  These shoes are easily hosed off if debris gets inside, and they are light weight and very comfortable.  I call them my new Bozo the Clown shoe because they are so wide, but I wear an 8.5, and the 6 -8 fits perfectly.  I just ordered another pair that may be less wide.  I cannot wait!  I'm a 64 year old lady chicken farmer with a closet full of fancy shoes that are going to be leaving!  I'd rather have Crocs for every occasion!",5, Navy,8.0,6.0,3,2018
Stephanie H.,Great fit and fun color,"  My old crocs finally came apart after many years of use, and I decided to invest in another pair to wear to the pool and around the house. These fit just like my old ones. They are snug enough to stay to on without the back strap down and loose enough in the toes to be comfortable. The nubby inside is not really uncomfortable, but not as nice feeling as a smooth insole would be. On the other hand, my bare feet would stick to a smooth plastic sole. . I do like that I can put my wet feet into them when I get out of the pool and I don't slip around in them. I love the color (turquoise)! While crocs aren't really a fashion statement, they are ok for a quick, casual trip to the grocery store or the postoffice. I'm happy with my purchase.",5, Pool,7.0,5.0,1,2020
Matt,Got tired of my wife stealing mine,"  Crocs are not the fashion statement of the decade, this is true. However(!), their staying power has everything to do with how functional and durable they are. Going out to get the mail, take out the trash, quick walk with the dog, they are quick on/quick off and more comfortable than they should be.Mine kept disappearing so I bought my wife her own pair. Problem solved. Sidenote: Mine are probably 6 years old and have been used far, far harder than any pair of shoes should be. They have paint on them, gouges from who knows what, are faded and don't look very good at all, but they strap is still completely intact and they are still very comfortable. I keep waiting for them to die so I can spring for new pair but they just keep going.",5, Black,8.0,6.0,0,2020
Quels,Fit smaller than expected,"  The product arrived on time and appeared to be good quality.  Unfortunately, the size 9 I ordered fit smaller than the size 8 I tried.  I will say I was pleased at how easy the return process was and would give the seller 5 stars for that.",4, Black,9.0,7.0,3,2020
Val,CROCS are great!,"  So many knock offs of crocs that it's easy to confuse them for the real thing. I've picked up the fake ones, even though I've had the real ones. But maybe your old ones wore out and you're at the everything for $5 store and you buy the crappy ones, and you just end up forgetting how great and different real crocs are. If you need extra room in the toe area to use toe separators, or you have wide feet, and/or you have some foot issues with pain, CROCS can be a saver for your feet. When I put mine on today, after having worn the crappy ones for a while, I was excited to have them again as I felt the little nubs inside stimulate my feet. They will help your circulation. I just love them!",5, Black,8.0,6.0,1,2020
Sar,Now I can be like Mario Batali...,"  With these shoes you too can be world renowned cooking stud Mario Batali...that‚Äôs COOKING stud, not creepy, fat ginger, who can‚Äôt keep his hands off the ladies ‚Äústud‚Äù...But these shoes won‚Äôt make you cook like Batali, but they will make you unattractive like Batali!!! BELLISSIMO!(Honestly, these things are ugly with anything you wear, BUT they are completely kooky and comfortable! I was wearing my kids that were a size 9 men‚Äôs with very little problem, even though I am a size 11, which I bought instead. I like the smaller nome look of the 9‚Äôs, but I was worried that another pair might be truer to my correct size of 11. I wasn‚Äôt taking any chances on them not fitting at all....I probably should have gotten a 10 because even though these fit, they just look clumsier and EVEN more outlandish. I kinda look like Batali!!Ewwwwwwwww",5, Pepper,13.0,11.0,0,2020
J,Used for a goose costume. Ran a mile in them. New favorite house shoes.,"  I've always made fun of crocs. Several years ago, I began to see their utility when it comes to camping. They are lightweight, easy to put on, easy to wash off, and most importantly... compatible with thick socks. But I still didn't buy myself a pair.I've been through 2 or 3 pairs of Croc Sexii flip flop sandals in the last few years, and I love them.So when Halloween rolled around last year, instead of ordering or making some silly one-use shoe covers for my Untitled Goose costume, I bought some bright orange crocs. It took a while to get used to the feeling of my foot being encased by solid plastic, but they're pretty comfortable.I had 2 pairs of flip flops break recently, and my crocs have since become my house shoes. Also one of my younger co-workers (who is all about fancy sneakers) is now wearing white crocs n socks to work every day, so... maybe they are cool now? Maybe?Also I ran a mile in them once at the end of a 5k fun run.",5, Tangerine,10.0,8.0,0,2020
lyss,I joined the CROCS club!,"  I purchased these for easy slip ons to go outside with my toddler.  We are usually in our backyard playing with water.  THESE ARE AMAZING FOR THAT!  I am so happy I joined the crocs club and I can't believe I didn't join the club sooner.  Below are the pros for these:1. They are great for people who have wide feet (like me)2. Perfect for easy slip on and run outside.3. Great for the beach, pool, any water activity.4. You can easily slip them on and/or you can put the back strap down and your foot is a little more secure.5. Easy to clean - If you have a colored pair (like me) and they get a little dirty you can use soap and water rub on them and they look brand new again.Cons -1. If you bend your foot and/or crouch down they can leave a little crease in the shoe.",5, Grass Green,6.0,4.0,1,2020
Retired Navy Chief,Had to give the Crocs a chance.  Glad I did.,"  I‚Äôm a late adapter to Crocs.  Arrived yesterday.  Initial reaction was the shoes were too long and wide, so I reluctantly put them back in the bag and started to return them.  Something urged me to actually try them on again.  I used the heel strap, walked around the house, then the yard, and next thing I knew, I wore them the rest of the day and long into the night. Eventually, I tried them without the heel strap and found they were just as secure and comfortable. I canceled the return request. Crocs are just different beasts; like Birkenstock‚Äôs or my K√§lso Earth Shoes.  For me, there was a brief learning curve/familiarization period.  I‚Äôm pleased with the Crocs.  Totally what I expected.  Comfortable.  Like walking on my Gel-Pro kitchen mats wherever I go.  I just didn‚Äôt appreciate that it would take a bit to get used to a new (to me) style of foot wear.  They seem like the Volvo of the shoe world. Happy with my purchase and got a nice deal on Amazon.",5, Khaki,13.0,11.0,0,2020
Lori,Crocs seem to run small.,"  I bought 2 pair of crocs in two different colors. I wear size 6 1/2 shoes and the crocs are a size 7. They just barely fit, they are almost too small. I have a pair of crocs, this exact size, bought about ten years ago, and they are about a half inch longer and a bit wider. I was hoping the pairs I bought would be that exact size. The old pair says ""Made in China"" and the new pairs say ""Made in Vietnam"" and ""Made in Mexico"". I'm happy with the looks and quality of the new crocs, just wish they were a tad larger, more like a size 7. In the photos, the shoe on the left is the new croc, the shoe on the right is my old croc. Note the size difference.",4, Slate Grey,7.0,5.0,3,2018
NinaTwoSix,Better than I expected,"  I bought these to wear in our boat to save my flip flops. We live on the beach and I wear flip flops pretty much all year long. I decided to buy my husband a pair of these because he was always getting his shoes wet (he refuses to wear flip flops) and thought I would get myself a pair as well. They are good for taking the dogs out in the rain, quick trips to the store, etc. I like them much better than I thought I would. I ordered a size up after reading reviews, but could have gotten my normal size and been fine. If I get another pair I will order my normal size. They clean up quickly and so far have been durable as my husband has been in pluff mud with them and they held up with no problems. I would definitely recommend these crocs",5, White,10.0,8.0,0,2020
WackyMom,Ugly but Useful,"  These shoes are not attractive at all, in my opinion, but they serve their purpose very well.I needed a pair of shoes I can just slip on and off to run out to the mailbox or take the dogs out.  I also wanted them to be easy to clean after working in the yard.  These shoes fit those needs well.I also like that there is an adustable heel strap to keep the shoe on even more securely, or it can be flipped up over the top of the foot to allow easy off and on.So, as long as no one is looking at my feet, these shoes are great.",4, Khaki,10.0,8.0,1,2020
C. D. Pritchard,"Easy to modify for plantar wart relief, treads wear quickly & are then slippery.","  Use a Dremel type tool with a 1/2"" diameter coarse sanding drum to carve out a relief for a plantar wart- otherwise the ""nubs"" inside will greatly pain you!  (See pic of hacked Croc)The soles on my 2018 vintage classic style Crocs wore out relatively quickly and these 2020 ones are of the same design and appear to be of the same material.  Once the treads are worn away, they are REAL slippery on smooth wet or merely damp surfaces.  I used the above Dremel rig to cut new grooves as treads in my old ones.Without socks, your feet will sweat a good deal, or at least it is more noticeable to me.  I just slip then off if I am stationary, so,  driving is the only time it bothers me- YMMV..Overall, they are a great value unless you go with sandals.",4, Khaki,11.0,9.0,0,2020
Janet,Life changing. Get a pair ASAP,"  I haven‚Äôt worn crocs since I was 5. I got the ballet pink ones because during this quarantine, I am tired of wearing uncomfortable shoes. I mainly got these to wear to take my dog out, cause they‚Äôre quick to put on and easy to wash if I step in something :/. But these arrived and I HAVE WORN THEM NONSTOP. Socks with Crocs is my new look. They are the quickest slip on shoes, they are just so useful! I wear them everywhere. When I‚Äôm cleaning the house, going to the store, to my parents- everywhere.Sizing: I am a women‚Äôs 8.5 and I have pretty chunky, wide feet. I got the women‚Äôs 9, men‚Äôs 11 and it actually fits perfectly, wouldn‚Äôt have changed a thing. Feels fairly true to size for me, because it does fit like a size 9 shoe would.

Jarrett Knottnerus,Finally got a pair. Not disappointed,  Been wanting a pair of these especially with my buddy hyping them up. Waited til prime day to get them on sale and have to admit that I love them. Am a huge fan now. Only down side is they don‚Äôt offer many in size 14 that I need so I miss out on the American flag ones or other cool designs. They feel a little loose but when you put em in sport mode (aka put the heel strap down) they stay put. Got them to wear on a my new boat but am using them everywhere. Will honestly admit I thought they‚Äôd be a tad more soft/comfortable. I have a pair of oofos slides that if they made crocs with the same softness would be game over. They just slip too much so they need the heel strap that crocs have.,5, Slate Grey,16.0,14.0,0,2020
Jeffrey 440,I really like my Crocs!,"  I have been wearing Crocs clogs for so many years and my first pair I got in 2002 finally wore out completely after 18 years of pretty constant wear. They are so comfortable to wear all day long with no problems. I do not wear socks with mine, just bare feet. Size is ""true to fit/fit as expected"". It seems every time I get a pair of Crocs, they are made at a different place. The 4 pairs I now got are either made in Mexico or Vietnam & are all comfy. The newest pair I got today was the white Crocs....made in China & they seem fine so far. For about $37 a pair, these Crocs will last so many years, be comfy and go thru mud, water, crud or whatever just fine....easy to clean for sure. 5 stars for these Crocs.",5, White,14.0,12.0,0,2020
Adrenaline,3 pairs of 12m all different sizes.,"  This is my 3rd pair of crocs all size 12m.  I got navy, then white, then khaki.  Oddly enough each color is a different size- khaki is smallest, navy is in the middle, and white was so big and klunky they made me look like an idiot.  All of them say size 12m on them so the factory must have standardization problems.  Good luck getting a pair that fits right.  My first pair, navy, fits better than the white and khaki so I kind of regret buying the white and khaki ones.  But crocs are the best.  I have been wearing crocs for a long time and they never stink and never make my feet stink and they are durable enough to hike or run or fight in self defense and I can kick them off when I go inside easily and slip them on when I go outside easily.  I just wish a 12m is always the same size no matter which color.",5, Khaki,14.0,12.0,0,2020

Mimi Jean,Loved them but reluctantly had to return,"  With a heavy heart I had to return these.  I purchased them because after shattering my ankle in Jan. my ankle/foot remains so swollen I can't get my old shoes on.  Was thrilled to find these shoes accommodated my left foot and thought all my problems were solved.  Unfortunately after a couple of hours of wearing I discovered I was in deep trouble with my right foot.  Years ago I had a hammer toe that the surgery did not repair.  That darn toe sticks up.  The clogs are molded, don't ""give"", and I was in trouble.  Needless to say this would not happen to a normal person.  Were I normal I would have kept them in a heartbeat..

I've got some high hopes based off of first hand accounts of friends and their own crocs. I'll likely follow up from time to time here! So here's hoping they last a good while!

Josh H,Great for heavy set LLC,  Get these now. They have always spiked my interest but I finally broke down and bought a pair. I usually always wear flip flops but wanted something a little bit different for when I‚Äôm out walking in the woods etc (taking pictures/magnet fishing) I just pop these bad boys into four wheel drive and get stepping. They are great for just lounging around the house too. I‚Äôll put them on around 7am and will basically forget they‚Äôre even on most of the day. The first day or so they felt a little different but after they broke in a little bit it‚Äôs almost as if they‚Äôre molded to my feet. Highly recommend them for anybody on their feet a lot or if your weight is pretty hefty. I‚Äôm so glad I bought these,5, Black,17.0,15.0,0,2020
Lynn G,Crocs... What Did You Expect?,"  Crocs will never be the most comfortable shoes.  They are an utility shoe for those of us who like to go barefoot around the house and need something to slip on to check the mail, grab the paper, put out the trash, or brave the harsh and hateful sun long enough to yell at the little jacktard from down the street who is letting his dog crap in your petunias for the 3rd time this week.  No, we don't wear them because we love the way they feel, we wear them because they are cheap and get the job done, and aren't all furry on the outside which attracts hair from the shedding freeloading bastard laying on the couch.",4, Lemon,13.0,11.0,4,2018

When you slip into these and walk around in them, you know then why so many people tend to buy them over and over. The support is exceptional, and they‚Äôre easy to clean. I got these for my husband because he kept slipping on his bedroom slippers to go out and get the mail, set out the sprinkler, etc., and it was driving me crazy. The nice thing about this pair of Crocs is that you can either slip right into them, or take an extra second and use the back strap. If you don‚Äôt use it it slides right on top easily. If you‚Äôve never worn Crocs before, give them a try. You‚Äôll love them.",4, Black,13.0,11.0,1,2019

He is a shoe hound, and ecstatic they are the only white shoes he has that are easy to keep clean and white, lol. He usually wears a size 13 sneaker but the 12 in crocs fits him best.

Not as wide from side to side. No pinching, slipping or stubbing. The ice blue color is exactly as pictured. It's not Turquoise or Aqua Marine blue. I wear size 8 medium (a 6 medium in mens). This clog is unisex. So glad I didn't have to buy them more expensive elsewhere. If you have very wide feet, I would consider ordering a different Crocs clog. Did I mention how comfortable and supportive they are? Important for bad backs, necks, foot problems. I wear mine as house slippers.",5, Ice Blue,8.0,6.0,1,2019

I just couldn‚Äôt get past the looks of them. Well I finally gave in and bought this pair. Oh my what have I been missing? They are so comfortable, and easy to slip on. You can get them as dirty as you want in the garden and then you just wash them off.  They provide good air flow so your feet don‚Äôt get sweaty. What more could you want in a pair of shoes? Ok so I probably couldn‚Äôt get away with going to a wedding in them, but wish I could, cause I‚Äôd have the most comfortable feet on the dance floor!

I was given a word of mouth recommendation for Crocs from a woman with feet problems from years of work on her feet.  I hesitated at first thinking do I need these given flip flops, sneakers etc.  I was not prepared for the little massage/stimulation like nodules inside which are great too.  I can't think of how anyone would not get a lot of wear and relief out of these shoes, particularly anyone who works on their feet.

I‚Äôm now 26 and now that I‚Äôve hit my quarter life crisis, I found myself ordering a pair. Saw my hubby wearing them and made fun of him every time I saw him wear them. Then one day I needed to put them on to grab something outside (seeing that those were the only ones near me lol). He is a size 12 and I‚Äôm a size 6.5 so you can only imagine how huge they felt. I saw the light that day and ordered a pair of crocs.ANYWAYS here‚Äôs what you ladies wanna know about the fit:- I‚Äôm a NARROW 6.5 in women (can fit 6 in heels and 7 in Nike‚Äôs)- the site says to size up if you are a half size BUT these are already ugly enough so I took my chances and sized down.- ordered a 6 in women (Army Green) and they fit PERFECTLY.- the shoe feels SLIGHTLY tight when I put it in ‚Äú4x4 mode‚Äù (as my hubby calls it lol) but it‚Äôs not enough to bug me.- hubby says they stretch out over time so there you go.I got these the day they were expected and I unfortunately have not worn any other shoe since receiving it. Who have I become? :(",5, Army Green,6.0,4.0,1,2020
Michele,So happy,  These are my first pair of Crocs. I only bought them because I needed easy slip on shoes for the summer for fishing that wasn‚Äôt open like sandals or flip flops but still breathable. And can I just say how absolutely happy I am that I bought these! I LOVE them and def will be buying more pairs now. (Never thought I would say that lol) They are so comfortable and I love the color. I‚Äôm usually a size 7-7 1/2 in shoes so I bought size 8 and they fit perfectly!,5, Cantaloupe,8.0,6.0,1,2020
Russell J.,Croc noobie,"  I have seen people wearing these for years and always thought they look ridiculous and couldn‚Äôt imagine how foam rubber shoes could be comfortable or durable. It‚Äôs obvious they aren‚Äôt stylish. After buying my very first pair of grass green size 15 crocs here for a crazy pre Christmas sale price of under 10$ with the free prime shipping, I‚Äôm amazed. After trying them on I no longer care how they look and I now get why they are popular. They are light durable and super comfy without feeling like you‚Äôre walking on marshmallows. In fact I was shocked how firm the foot bed is without being hard. I no longer care how they look. Not sure I would wear them to a wedding but for around the house and yard they are perfect.",5, Grass Green,17.0,15.0,2,2019
Edwin Anthony Aurelio,Comfort! Ventilation! Durability!,"  The Classic Clog line of Crocs serves my needs perfectly.  I can no longer wear normal shoes because my feet require more oxygen than those of most people, but I hate slippers and sandals (or going barefoot).  The Crocs Classic Clogs provide the ventilation I  need while still feeling like shoes, they're also very comfortable with cushioning thick soles and they're durable, lasting for a long time with no damage even after 3 years of daily use.  They're also cheap compared to others.  Yes, they're ugly, but you can get them in pretty colors to compensate, like these bright yellow ones.  For die hard Crocs fans like myself, buying one pair may lead to buying a dozen or more so be warned.  Emphasis on Classic Clog line.  The other models of shoes Crocs makes provide less ventilation and my feet aren't as comfortable in them.",5, Lemon,10.0,8.0,0,2020
Marcy,Comfortable!,"  So I'll be the first one to tell you that I thought Crocs were the ugliest thing ever.My sister ended up getting some because she needed something comfortable and told me ""they had cute colors"". After a week she told me I should definitely get some since they truly are comfortable.I was skeptical but I took the plunge. I ordered the cherry blossom color and when they arrived, I immediately tried them on. They are super comfortable!I now wear them all the time. The cherry blossom color is super cute and I definitely am alleviating my feet pain walking around the house now.Strongly recommend these!",5, Blossom,7.0,5.0,0,2020
Amazon CustomerJim,Treat yourself to another Croc color.,"  Great house slippers. Just read reviews that mention this. I wear a 10  EEEE, so these were perfect. I ordered the 10, and the classic crocs width was an excellent fit. If you have a narrower foot, D size and below, check out reviews on other Croc models that are narrower. Just pay attention to the number of reviews that mention whether the length is too short, this you may have to order one size larger, but the decrease in width should not be a problem for those with narrow, D and bellow. Crocs are so comfortable and easy to slip on and off I ordered another pair. And because they come in so many colors, you can order another color that pleases you, something to treat yourself to, as they are reasonably priced. Amazon‚Äôs selection is hit or miss, with many selections not available in all sizes and colors. So try Zappos. Amazon owns them anyway. And they always have free shipping and free returns.",5, Khaki,12.0,10.0,0,2019
NinaTwoSix,Hubby didn‚Äôt want any but now wears them all the time!,"  I ordered these crocs for my husband. We live at the beach and have a boat and he‚Äôs forever getting his shoes wet and/or leaving them outside. He swore he would never wear crocs. Well, he loves them!! Other than while at work he won‚Äôt wear anything else now, lol. Even went fishing on the boat with them and said that was the best thing ever! He‚Äôs so happy that I bought them for him and ‚Äúencouraged‚Äù him to wear them. They fit true to size, and he has plenty of room in them even though he has wide feet. He even loves the little ‚Äúmassaging things‚Äù in the soles. üòÅ So glad he no longer leaves any shoes outside!!",5, Black,11.0,9.0,0,2020
Lindy68,Love My Orange Crocs,"  This is my first pair of crocs; never had the desire to own any. But now, can't imagine being without them! I needed something easy to slip into and take off when I'm down at the horse barn, feeding and cleaning corrals. Also nice that they are waterproof, unlike my old leather clogs. Excellent price, too . At first, I thought they were going to be floppy on my feet; I did purchase the size I usually wear. I wear socks with the crocs, sometimes two pair in the cooler months. They still fit just fine. I have narrow to medium width feet, wear a size 10. I like the orange because they're easy to spot wherever I've left them. Easy to clean off the dirt, either brush off or hose off; I understand they can be thrown in the washer, too. And, best of all, these crocs are as comfortable as my slippers I wear around the house. Sometimes, I forget I wore my crocs in the house, noticing sometimes hours later! Love them! And convinced my husband to order some, too! He loves his, too!",5, Tangerine,10.0,8.0,0,2018
Thomas K. Seibold,Completely Croc-ish,"  You know the drill--They're comfortable but so unstylish that they're stylish. Well, I don't think this classic style of Crocs will ever be stylish, to my eye, but we buy them for comfort and versatility, right? My old pair were so worn that they started to slip on wet surfaces so I knew it was time for replacement. These fit well, though the rear strap is now tighter than the originals I got 15 years ago. The upside is they'll stay on better than the old ones--the downside is that if you plan to use the strap, you'll have to reach down and use a finger to stretch it around the back of your foot. It's fine--just different than the old looser strap.",5, Slate Grey,11.0,9.0,0,2020
Leo Hott,These things ROCK!!!,  My wife has to put in 8 hour shifts on 2 feet that are suffering!!!  17+ hour shift working for REGIS many years ago tore her Plantar Facia & a Ankle tendon or ligament & these are the only shoes she can wear along with tape & ankle support that can see her through a shift!!!

Marilyn W.,Just like the originals!,  I have a pair of original Crocs that I bought 15 years ago and absolutely love them.  But the soles finally wore through and I needed to finally get another pair.  The size stamped on the bottom says W6-7.  I started looking on Amazon and couldn't believe how many styles of Crocs there are.  All I wanted was another pair just like my old ones.  I saw these Crocs Unisex Classic Clog and they looked almost identical to what I have.  I got a size 7 in Pepper and they are perfect.  I plan on ordering a couple more pairs.  Not for when these wear out (they seem to last forever) but there are so many great colors now.,5, Pepper,7.0,5.0,2,2018
Amazon Customer,Functionally great. They're basically flipflops with better functionality.,"  I was going to buy slippers to wear in my yard and patio since it's been annoying to put shoes on whenever taking my dog outside or to take the trash out. But I went with Crocs since they are just as comfortable while also allowing me to run around if needed (ie. dog randomly feels like running around the backyard).It does its job and is comfortable enough. If anyone thinks Crocs are ugly or think they are bad purchases, they should relax. They're functionally great the way one would wear ""fat pants"" or an old t-shirt around the house. I'm not planning on wearing this to a Michelin Star restaurant.Things to be aware of:1. Seems to run half a size large.2. Not as cushioned as expected.",4, Black,11.0,9.0,1,2018
Lailani,Comfy shoes,"  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!! I am a 7 1/2 so i went with an 8 and it fits well enough. Sometimes it feels like its a little big, if i went a size lower, I think it would be too snug. I may get a size 7 next just so i have a snug pair lol",5, Deep Green,8.0,6.0,2,2020
Raggie,Hooked.,"  I'm simply hooked. I'm currently training for a very strenuous distance running challenge (fingers crossed it still happens). Plantar fasciitis slowly crept up on me, and these are one of the top solutions I've found. Yes, they are an eyesore, but that doesn't mean they can't be the most versatile eyesore in the house! I have used them for years to help with low back problems from walking on concrete floors in my college dorm to having a carefree solution for gardening. Oh! And I've been known to use them for their intended purpose of fishing on occasion. They are the best. Do yourself a favor and grab a pair.",5, Neo Mint,9.0,7.0,0,2020
ninilovestea,Great house shoes!,"  I‚Äôm using these as house shoes for when I move to Japan! I am a true to size women‚Äôs 9.5. I always get a size 10 on Crocs. I‚Äôve never had classic crocs before, but I‚Äôve heard that these feel a little big on the feet. Since all the crocs I‚Äôve worn have been 10‚Äôs, I just got the 10 anyway. When I first put them on, I thought these were going to be too big since I have narrow feet, but once I started walking around in them, they never slipped off my feet with the heel strap. I don‚Äôt really use them without the strap. They are roomy and comfortable! I think you should try getting your regular size before thinking of sizing down. See how they fit you personally before deciding to go a full size down.",5, Melon,10.0,8.0,2,2019

Myopic Topics,Super Comfortable Waterproof Shoes For Around The House,"  Croc‚Äôs are super comfortable shoes for messing around the house and outside.  My wife bought an off brand as a second pair for indoors (no outside shoes in our house) that looked like Crocs but hurt her toes.  I bought her this pair of black crocs and she loves the feel, although she hates the black color as she has others in pink,  but black was the only color in stock.  We highly recommend Crocs for bumming around the house,  or going to a water park or beach.  They are not stylish,  so probably wouldn‚Äôt recommend wearing outside of the house other than the beach.",5, Black,9.0,7.0,1,2020
ToTellTheTruth,Half-size ordering down isn't perfect for me but going up to next size would be way too big. What to do!?,"  They arrived today and because I wear a 9.5, I ordered a half-size down but with the strap around the back of my foot, my toes are hitting up against the front too much. I'm a bit bummed as I ordered exactly as this site and the Cros.com site said to do with half-sizes....order down!  BUT I have to say that going to a 10 would be ridiculous as I only need about 1/2 size more & I don't want to fall out of them = tripping potential. Now what? Do they stretch out a bit. I hope so as I ordered a white pair in 9 from Crocs.com too as I was so sure after trying on my friend's size 8's. We both agreed to order one size up for me. I can wear them, and will but my idea to order a bunch more in different colors went out the window...",4, Ice Blue,9.0,7.0,3,2017
Justthe2ofus,Good old favorites,"  As expected, this is my son's 3rd pair same brand and color, I keep getting a size up toward the middle of every summer, he wears them quite a while that way. These are great for running in the sprinkler or playing in a sandbox or working in a vegetable garden, or for a rainy day or sand dune trip or beach trip. They can hurt the arches after a while so I don't recommend them for amusement parks or hiking.",5, Navy,8.0,6.0,1,2020

Daniel,Black Crocs are great!,"  Our near-two-year-old has been sporting several pairs of crocs for the last year and loves them. Eventually my wife got a pair, and now I have them, too.For home use they are absolutely fantastic. It feels like walking on clouds or something. The arch support is surprisingly good, too. They fit just enough but have just enough space to feel easy to slip on and off, but have enough traction to keep your feet in them if you are wearing them like slippers.Easy to wash. Comfortable. Light weight. Etc.Couldn‚Äôt be happier!",5, Black,12.0,10.0,1,2019

Jessica ,Perfect for picking up my kid!,  I often wear thick fuzzy socks in the house I needed something that I could slip on really quick on my way to pick up or drop off my kid at school. With flip flops I have to take socks off and I'm self conscious about if I have to make a quick stop and having ashy feet yikes! But these will allow me keep on my thick socks and run out the door plus winter is coming so the thicker the socks the better. I love that they have holes too so I dont have to worry if they get wet.

Ms. Tee,Let me be honest: I LOVE THESE SHOES,"  So, prior to looking on Amazon, I had only owned and purchased garden shoes from my local Ollie's. My feet felt good but I never knew there was a supportive sole like CROCS until these came in the mail. I have poor arch support and my feet literally hurt all of the time unless I am wearing a supportive sneaker or tennis shoe. These shoes do not hurt my feet and I can walk a few miles in them. My feet fit snuggly in these shoes and they are my go to when I am not working out. This was a great deal and I am looking to purchase more in the near future. Great comfortable shoe!",5, Ice Blue,8.0,6.0,0,2020
MWM,I like these,"  These are my first pair of Crocs, and they will not be the last.  Comfort level is absolute bliss & wonderful, and the bright color keeps me from tripping over them in low light.

When they came they fit perfectly, being the same size that I'm used to.I had previously ordered my old (5 - 8 years old)  croc size, which was an 8-10.The crocs that came were from heel to toe a full inch shorter.The current size crocs seem to try to math you shoe size better.

Cmueller6878,"Amazing, beautiful, majestic: the croc","  Crocs.... oh man.... I once hated them and all of their glory. But... now I see the passion and light of the croc. I found out I owned crocs in 2010 and had tons of jibbitz. I was a croc enthusiast. (I even had multiple pairs of the same croc just because I guess). ‚ÄúWhy the croc‚Äù, they ask; and to that I say why not the croc.Now I have changed my eyes and I see the past me was correct and that being a croc enthusiast IS my passion and will forever be my passion. Once my crocs arrived I immediately opened the box and started decorating. Me and my mother have the same shoe size so we are ‚Äúsharing‚Äù them even though they are mine (she agreed).If you don‚Äôt own crocs I recommend that you immediately purchase a pair (or more if you are smart).The beautiful lavender color suits my skin tone very well. I will never be the same without my crocs by my side. Buy a pair of these crocs now. Sports mode is comforting knowing that your croc is safe and sound on your foot.

One day my son asked me for a pair and I got the wrong size, I missed the return date and had to keep them.  Boy was I happy that I still had them when my feet had swollen up like the Pillsbury Dough Boy and these were the only thing that would fit.  They are SUPER comfortable.  The swelling in my feet have gone down and I've since bought a pair that fits me.  I wear them all day (I work from home) and highly recommend them.  I also had a plantar wart directly on the heel of my foot and these were almost the only shoe that was comfortable until it went away.  Buy these shoes.

I love all the colors and they are great for around the house and walking my dog, especially after a long day at work wearing my flats. Trust me if you are having second thoughts about these you need to try for yourself. The fit is great too! I‚Äôm a solid women‚Äôs  7 1/2 and I purchased a women‚Äôs size 8.

Vuong Ly,Runner-Up!,"  I have to be honest. I've never been a fan of the way Crocs look and have never given it a chance. I added this to my dad's collection of shoes for him to pick from. He suffers from gout so I've been buying tons and tons of shoes, trying to find him the perfect pair to alleviate the pain as much as possible when he walks. I have to say, these are quite comfy. They're waterproof, super flexible, and made of great material. I won't deduct any stars for the looks since it's a subjective matter. While these are not my dad's go-to shoes, they definitely surprised me at how nice they feel. My dad fits a size 9 and the shoe itself is true to size.Value 5/5 *****. Comfort 5/5 *****.

Now that I have I pair I love them yea they are not the nicest looking. That don‚Äôt matter the arch support is great much better than most flip flops. I don‚Äôt think I will ever buy another pair of rubber flip flops. These have replaced all my sandals except for rainbow flip flops.,5, Khaki,12.0,10.0,1,2020

There‚Äôs litto nubs on the inside of the sole that feel really nice. The bottom outside sole is also pretty slip proof.Can‚Äôt wait to rock my Crocs! It‚Äôs cole rn but they are comfy for house slippers or going out to run errands in as long as it‚Äôs not raining. It‚Äôs cold rn so I may pair with fun socks and leggings for a casual look but they def look better with shorts.Looking forward to getting more colors!!,5, Khaki,7.0,5.0,4,2017
JLee,Crocs Classis Clogs are the best for summer,"  I love the class Crocs clog.  My feet swell in hot, humid weather, and these are the only shoes I can tolerate.  I also walk several miles a day to and from work, and these are the best.I buy wear a size six-and-a-half, and I order the Crocs in size seven to give my feet room to swell.  In cooler weather, I wear socks; hot weather, no socks.  Also, putting the strap on the back of my heel holds them on when my feet aren‚Äôt swelling.  When they swell, I push the strap up to the top of the shoe.They provide excellent arch support.  I have very high arches and a very high instep and I am very comfortable in these shoes.The main drawback is that if it is raining and you walk into a store with smooth floors, swoosh, slip, slide.  You have to be very careful.  Usually, there is a mat to wipe your shoes at the entrance.  Use it.Also, I have a friend with MS who tells me these shoes do not provide enough lateral support, so if you are unfortunate enough to share that need, these shoes are not sufficient.  For everyone else, they are terrific, very, very comfortable.You can wash your Crocs, best to use a damp cloth, but you can put them in the sink if they get filthy.  Most of the time, an occasional swipe along the inside with damp cloth or paper towel is all you need to prevent them picking up odors.  If they start to squeak, put some vegetable oil on them overnight and then wipe them off in the morning with a paper towel.If they are too big, put them in the dryer with a damp towel for a few minutes.  If they are too small, do the same, but take them out and put them on and walk around in them to stretch them.",5, Black,7.0,5.0,3,2015

Will,Misleading Images,"  I ordered the 'Pepper' colored classic clog. The pepper color that was advertised in the images was this blueish blackish shade croc sort of like the navy color that is advertised but a shade lighter. The actual pepper clog is a bright red croc, but not necessarily neon red its kind of like the color of a pepper. I'm not really upset with the actual croc but more so that I didn't get the product that was advertised by the images. So I guess buyer beware and look up the colors on google images beforehand to make sure that you're getting the color you actually want. I'll add more to this review if there are any further issues down the line.",4, Pepper,13.0,11.0,1,2020
GuySoCool,Just order them already!!!,"  If you are in the reviews you have come to terms with looks. So are they comfortable you might ask, OF COURSE THEY ARE!

A feather lite cloud of fairies gently stimulating your feet, bringing comfort and relaxation with their sweet embrace. While a wide toe box gives ample room to stretch your sweet little piggies.Wish I had done this years ago, but alas vanity got the better of me.

I was so happy because my child is so picky and particular on everything.  She wears a 8 and that's what I bought and she said they didn't really slip off... So I think that means because she was wearing socks, she didn't feel the slipping and she said she changed from sports mode back to non-sport throughout the day. She said she mostly wore sports mode because she walks alot on her job.",5, Black,8.0,6.0,0,2020

They are now my to go shoes, I thought they were going to be a little small, but no, they fit perfectly, and have enough breathing space, my feet don't feel crammed in them.

ShilohLauren ,Ugliest most delightful shoes,  I have converted to the croc side and I am a believer.  They are so ugly!!!! But good lord they are the most comfortable shoes. Great for walking in wet grass believe it or not. I come home from work throw on my crocs and am ready to walk my dogs. They stay on your feet rather well too w.o the strap i don't know what magic it is but I love it. Even bought my boyfriend a pair and after weeks of fighting me he now wheres his even more than I wear mine. Id recommend getting a neutral color of you think they're as ugly as i do.  Draws less attention.,5, Neon Purple,8.0,6.0,0,2020
Sarah Hook,Crocs for House Shoes,  My hubby purchased these for his size 13 feet. They feet well and he finds them comfortable. They are worn around the house while he is doing work. We have a new construction house built by the worst builder ever. We've had a lot of things we have had to fix ourselves and these make comfy and affordable shoes to be worn while doing these house fixes. They are as described and pictured. Fit as expected. I also have a pair to wear around the house because I like to wear shoes. We both would highly recommend crocs for this purpose.,5, Slate Grey,15.0,13.0,0,2020
Chloe F.,Love these -- from a croc convert,"  I have long been a croc hater until I bought them for my daughter a year or two ago and realized how easy and comfortable they are. Then, I bought myself a pair. I wear them everyone. I get shamed by my boyfriend, but these are extremely comfortable and super duper easy. They're easy to clean, easy to slip on, great for gardening and outdoor work because they basically don't stain or scuff. I've also noticed that since I've started wearing them around the house, I don't wake up with plantar fasciitis anymore. I'll probably buy a few more pairs so I can have some color variety.",5, Ballerina Pink,9.0,7.0,0,2020
Majesta,A little smaller than my old Crocs,"  Although I love having a new pair of Crocs, and these look great, these are just a wee bit smaller than the same size I bought some years ago.  Those were 5/7, and so are these.I can wear them, but right this moment, sitting down, the top of my left foot is hurting.  I have had them for three days. Same size, but years apart, and the original was made is Mexico, these in Vietnam.If I didn't dread the whole RETURN issue, I would trade them in for one size larger....sigh.",5, Black,7.0,5.0,0,2020
Charles B,"Typical 10.5, Ordered 11 - Fits Perfect","  If you ever have to go up a half size (especially for sandals, or fear that the back of your heel will hang), just order the next size up. I am glad that I did, as these fit my feet perfectly, with little to no room once I push my feet all the way in the shoe. I would imagine that had I ordered a size down, these would have been a horrible fit. (Normally can order down on tennis shoes and they fit fine).These were a little wide, but  I sometimes feel that's how CROCS made them to either feel/fit. I think they are the perfect outdoor shoe for rainy weather. The Lavender was an excellent color choice. I would highly recommend these shoes to anyone.",5, Lavender,11.0,9.0,0,2020
Mary,One word... WOW!,"  I bought these because the reviews said it helped people with their plantar fasciitis pain and I was suffering a lot every day. My daughter had raved about hers. It took me about 2 weeks to decide if they were helping. When I woke up one day and had no pain at all I realized they had worked all along but it took my body awhile to feel the effects. I think it took awhile to get used to the feeling of this type of shoe also. So far I am loving them. I also noticed that all of the cracks I had around my heels and the ball of my feet are now gone. They are completely healed in just a few weeks that I have been wearing these. I have used so many lotions etc with no success and wearing these shoes for just this short time took them away. I don‚Äôt understand how but that is an amazing bonus. for anyone that has experienced painful, cracked skin on your feet you will appreciate these. Wow is all I can say!!",5, Blossom,7.0,5.0,0,2020
Debbie,Try these!!,"  I‚Äôm not one to like wearing shoes,  I always thought Crocs looked hideous.One day I had to go outside in a hurry and the quickest thing I could grab was my sons crocs.They felt so nice even a few sizes too big at the time. I started wearing his to walk the dogs and decided it was time to get me a pair. I haven‚Äôt taken them off since except to sleep! I have plantar fasciitis and have had no problem since buying these. I did buy a size up so they are loose fitting. I tried a pair of my daughters after purchase and they fit snug and perfect at my normal size of 7 1/2. I do not believe you will regret buying these.",5, Navy,8.0,6.0,1,2020
Allie ,Pain free!,"  I destroyed my ankle 3 years ago and have been living in chronic pain ever since. I've tried everything known to man. Even those super expensive shoes where they scan your foot. And yet still, pain. Working on my feet for 12+ hours a day didn't help. I came home every night a cripple. There have been days I have crawled from my car to my door. I've worn crocs every day for a solid week and it has been the first week since my accident that I have been almost pain free. I wear these suckers hard. Working 12+ hours in a hospital, on a concrete floor, running around like a chicken with its head cut off- AND THE CROCS MADE IT. I came home and cleaned my house after working a 13 hour shift because my ankle didn't hurt. I'm a believer. Thanks Crocs!",5, Black,8.0,6.0,0,2019
Goth Gone Grey,Guilty pleasure shoes,"  Classicly ugly, weird looking clown shoes that everyone - including me - loves to make fun of.  And yet, within five minutes of getting home for the night, I'm wearing these.They're comfortable, are well ventilated enough to let my feet air out (foot funk is truly nasty) and don't slip off as easily with the strap in back.  They're also durable, I've had this pair for 5 years and while they show some wear, they're still comfortable.  In the house.  With nobody looking.",5, Black,10.0,8.0,3,2018
Andrea,the shoe that lasts forever,"  Crocs are not going to get you noticed by the opposite sex, but they are comfortable and they last forever. Whether you are going to the grocery store, the garden, or the pool, you can't go wrong in Crocs. My kids are even asking for Crocs now, so I guess they are cool again. So, no worries if you buy them and they are not cool....just wait a while and they will come back in style. If they get dirty, hose them down. Do not leave in the sun, though, unless you need some shoes for your child's doll.",5, Tangerine,13.0,11.0,0,2020
Amber Britton,Love me my new crocs!,  I have very wide feet so this is the perfect shoe for ultimate comfort. The cool blue color is super cute and it was discounted so I got over $11 off the original price! Perfect shoe for working on my feet all day. Probably could have gone with a size smaller because my there‚Äôs too much room in the back but it might‚Äôve been too tight in the toes that way. Overall very happy with my purchase!

Drachen,"The ideal ""short walk outside"" footwear","  You either love or hate these types of shoes. I'm a fan of them, and they're especially useful for quick visits outside or around the pool. They're quality, and you can expect them to hold up over time as long as you're not overexerting them. In terms of comfort, it's what you'd expect, so if you have overly sensitive feet or something that requires specific support, I would look elsewhere.I recommend staying true to your size when looking for a pair.",4, Navy,16.0,14.0,1,2019
Carol F.,"They are lightweight, comfortable and true to size ordered.","  After my Orthopaedic doctor said my professional orthotics will take a few weeks to get, I ordered these; his recommendation. Instead of wearing no shoes around house, these provide comfort & support for my flat feet, need for an arch and there‚Äôs some give when walking to help with arthritis and plantar fasciitis. Very glad I ordered these. They‚Äôre lightweight, waterproof and easy to wash. You can travel with them, wear them in the shower, hotel rooms and air your feet out in the summer months. The strap is a nice option you can use or flip up and not use. Lov‚Äôem‚Äô",4, Black,11.0,9.0,0,2020
Chris m.,Buy These To Become A Sex Symbol,"  Best sexual aid I have come across. Single? This is the best (legal) seduction tool on the market. Married? I can guarantee these shoes will bring passion back into your relationship. No one can resit the pure sex appeal offered by these crocs. While not using them as a pure sexual stimulant, I employ them as camp footwear (only while camping alone, for obvious reasons). Not that it will matter to anyone, but I used these throughout the Tahoe Rim Trail, and my only complaint is that my hiking poles broke while trying to fight off the many admirers.",5, Navy,12.0,10.0,0,2020
georgiaboy,Can‚Äôt beat them,  Just bought my second pair. Have tried the cheaper brands and they don‚Äôt measure up as far as cushioning and foot grip. The cushioning is wonderful with crocs if you have foot pain. They also stay on your feet without any feeling of tightness. I‚Äôve lived in them since the pandemic started and because of heel bursitis clog style shoes like these are about the only thing I can wear.Great product particularly if you get them for $30 or less.,5, Chocolate,15.0,13.0,0,2020
Chloe Steiner,SO FAR VERY DURABLE FOR WHAT THEY ARE PUT THROUGH AND SUPER COMFORTABLE,"  A little expensive, but I guess that's what you have to pay nowadays for quality Crocs. I love them, I wear them around the farm and I have had them for about a month and they have held up nice. In fact my horse stepped on my toes today and the Crocs kept him from slicing my feet up. They are super comfortable on my feet, my mom put them on and said they felt like a massage for your feet. So, mom approved. I've used these Crocs for anything and everything, doing hay, working with animals, mucking out stalls, lots of moving around and they still look great. Highly recommended so far.",5, Black,10.0,8.0,0,2020
Jeff,"Great casual clogs, but they run quite a bit bigger than normal for the size.","  I had Crocs and loved them several years ago, but these newer ones seem to run quite a bit larger than I remember them, and I'm not fan of the addition of the textured area that comes in contact with the soles of my feet. Still a very good product, but beware of ordering down a size, and if you plan to go barefoot rather than wear sox you'll have to deal with a very noticeable and slightly irritating ""pimpled"" contact area where the soles of your feet rest.",4, Chocolate,11.0,9.0,0,2020
Jared Davis,Comfort at the cost of style.,"  Honestly, I never thought in a million years I would wear Crocs, let alone actually enjoy wearing them. They are actually a daily driver in my shoe repertoire. I pretty much only wear them around the house but for a house shoe, they are just too comfortable to give up. It's been around 9 months since I got them and they are holding up amazingly well. I still wear them around the house daily. One con I can give them is that you HAVE to wash them at least weekly otherwise they will absolutely reek. I'm not sure what causes it since my other shoes don't smell at all but these get ripe really easily.The shoe, in general, is bigger than what the packaging says just because they make the width a little bigger so make sure to measure your foot (there are guides out there to figure out your croc size) before you buy.",5, Navy,11.0,9.0,0,2020
Kitty,Comfy but came in a box big enough for 4 pairs.,"  I got these as shower clogs, and they work fine, I do find the bumps in the bed of the shoes are a little annoying right after putting them on, but the odd sensation seems to fade.I gave these five stars. but the crazy box they came in was absurd.  Seriously 1  pair of size 10 shoes in a box that was 3 to 4 times too long.When the husband brought the box in from the porch, I hadn't a clue what was in a box long enough to have housed a 4 person tent.I guess they must have been out of shoe box size containers that day.  Crazy.I wish I had taken a picture!  but alas, it was recycled before I thought about it.Bottom line the Crocs are great though.",5, Navy,10.0,8.0,1,2018
ALF Engineer,Dorky as expected but super comfortable!,"  Crocs are dorky but keep your feet cool, great on wet days, very comfortable, easy to get on and off and last.Although I swore I wasn't going to buy shoes on the internet due to the hassle of getting a good fit, I did it again. Even with free returns a one hour shoe buying trip can take weeks to get the size right online due to the shipping back and forth. Why did I do it? Crocs closed all of their retail stores near us. I tried looking in the larger retailers that Croc says carry their shoes and found that they didn't!These were to replace an identical pair I've owned for 6 years. The tread was gone so it as time. I checked the reviews and the Amazon shoe sizer and decided to go 1 size smaller than my old pair which were comfortable but a little large. Not knowing whether Crocs had changed/improved the last for their shoe after a few years even getting the same model can be a guess on size. These are also comfortable but the smallest Size 11s I own. Overall I'm happy.",4, Navy,13.0,11.0,0,2017
Eddie day,Don‚Äôt knock it till you try it.,  Ok...:not gonna lie...I‚Äôve hated crocs for years. They aren‚Äôt exactly dress shoes nor athletic shoes. They always looked uncomfortable to me and no one could convince me otherwise. Until now. My wife had an emergency c-section and was in the hospital for weeks. My baby is in the NICU right now. I‚Äôve been walking these hard hospital floors for weeks and thought my feet were going to fall off. Enter my brother in law who brought me a pair of his crocs. At this point I was willing to try anything. They were absolutely amazing!! Not just comfortable but the arch support was amazing!!! The width is perfect so that your feet aren‚Äôt squeezed in and it‚Äôs honestly like getting a foot rub with every step!!! So yeah....I‚Äôm the proud convert and owner of crocs.  Love these things!!!,5, Navy,11.0,9.0,0,2019
J Morse,Go with your gut. If you wear a half size go with the bigger size.,  This is my first pair of crocs and I really didnt know what size to buy since I have a high instep and I can wear really anything from a 8 to 9. I bought the female 8 size and they are the exact size of my foot. If you want something loose go with the size up for sure. Very happy with my purchase and I'm a believer now. These are awesome!!!!,5, Pool,8.0,6.0,1,2020

As long as he's happy, these are worth the buy.  Threw in some shoe charms so he can keep up with the local trend.

The background shade of blue is a little lighter than it appears on my screen. Goes perfectly with my jeans.I highly recommend these shoes, and all Crocs for that matter.

This is very helpful when packing for traveling.",5, Black,8.0,6.0,6,2016
Crusty Critic,Cosy Toes,"  I have hammer toes and the previous type of Crocs I got, although more, shall we say, fashionable, hurt my toese because they didn't have enough height.  These are perfect, with sufficient height so my toes slide right in.  They are comfortable, and do not slide off.  I usually don't use the heel catch, but when I need to (outside), it helps keep them firmly on my feet.  They also seem to be long wearing: I have a much older pair that I use for yard work, and they are barely worn.",5, Melon,11.0,9.0,0,2020

We've had them since the end of June and today  continue to be in great shape even though they've been worn pretty much every day. They are sturdy and easily washable.

They all have adopted the newer hard bottoms. I wanted to find these classic ones because I loved to wear them around the house as indoor slippers. Just for some context, I'm Asian, and we don't wear shoes into the house. Partially to keep the floors clean, but probably some other cultural reason that I haven't looked into yet. We have specific indoor slippers. I haven't looked too much into slippers, but I know these are good in the winter time because they can keep my feet warm and are easy to wash if they start to smell.The only problem I have with these are that it's hard to know what size to buy without trying them on, but that's just me.",5, Pepper,13.0,11.0,2,2017

This new pair is fine really but nothing like the just soft enough, just firm enough old pair that I still have. I slip my feet into that old pair and my feet stop barking and start purring. They are a treasure. If my life was a nation they would be a National Treasure.So I was very sad that these new ones were not exactly like my old ones. If you didn't have my old ones to compare to you might not know what you were missing. I did not post a review at the time of purchase as I was too busy worrying about Covid and life and survival.

Then I finally got a pair two weeks ago. And not just any pair, bright yellow. If I'm gonna hate on Croc's why not do it loudly. I just so happened to be on vacation last week, which required 10+ miles of walking per day. I wore them like my life depended on it. And alas, I find myself begrudgingly a fan. They are really well designed, so simple, but so effective. Everywhere slippers, and when I say everywhere, that includes lobster boats, scaling the rough coastline of Maine, walking endless long dirt roads, outdoor showers on the beach. I am a Croc convert, but now make fun of myself.",5, Lemon,15.0,13.0,0,2020
Discerning Customer,Needs softness,"  I had a pair which I got over a decade ago. Until recently I had kept them by the door for quick trips outside. Then I got planter fasciitis, and they became my everyday shoe. This replacement is not as soft and comfortable. Maybe it is because the older shoe was of aged material, is was softer. I wish they were still wearable. These replacements are still better than any other option though.",4, Lapis,10.0,8.0,0,2020
IslandLady_04,Comfort is AMAZING!!,"  I love these shoes!! It‚Äôs like walking on clouds. The only thing I‚Äôd change is getting a larger size. They fit perfectly, for me personally I‚Äôd like a little wiggle room.",5, White/Green Ombre,8.0,6.0,2,2020
Lisa R,Amazing Comfort,"  These Crocs are softer than I imagined, fit a bit wider than I was hoping for, and the arch support is not there for me, but I have high arches.However,  They are amazing in comfort!  Personally this is not something I would want to wear on a day with a lot of walking, but I may try a 1/2 size smaller (if they make them that way).I am normally a 6 in everything so I bought a 6.they are too wide for my feet and I cannot walk in them without the heel strap or my feet come out of them.with the strap they're great.I have told others to try them for their amazing comfort.I just need to find the right size for my feet.I wear these every day since I got them so they're not so big I cannot use them.I definitely recommend these to family and friends.",5, Black,6.0,4.0,2,2016
Caroline Sanchez,The comfortable hot girl summer shoe üíÄ.,"  Listen, this is a comfortable hot girl summer at its finest. It is way too hot to be out here in sneakers, so slides and crocs it is. Depending on what color you choose, you can get them to match with anything, or just get two pairs. I loved them so much that I'm going to get another pair.My only thing with these is that I'm a half size. My feet are a size 9.5 (ik the small feet girls are scared rn). The size 9 don't fit me, but the size 10 are a slight bit big for me. It's not like they're dramatically big, just more wiggle room than expected. But who cares, they're cute! Go get some, sis.",5, Lavender,10.0,8.0,0,2020
Jeffrey 440,Crocs are nearly perfect for me,"  I've been wearing Crocs for over 12 years now and they don't cost much, easy to clean up, durable, comfy to wear and lasts a long, long time!! Size is ""as expected"" I get their basic or classic clogs and flip the strap up so I can just slide them on/off my feet & wear them nearly everywhere. They may look dorky, but they are about the most comfortable shoes I have ever worn in my life....so far!! 5 stars!!",5, Black,14.0,12.0,0,2020
callisun2000,"So Ugly, they‚Äôre cute!","  I finally bought my teenage daughter some crocs of her own. I‚Äôve worn them as slippers for years. They were recommended from a podiatrist for my plantar fasciitis. Now She doesn‚Äôt have to steal mine to walk her dog. I never thought she would even like them, but she loves them! They‚Äôre easy to slip on over her slipper socks and they‚Äôre a cute fun color!",5, Lavender,6.0,4.0,1,2020
Nathan,Great Product with Great Customer Service,"  The customer support was great! I originally purchased a size too small, and they sent me the correct size a day later. I was blown away at how quickly the replacement came. The sizes are true to form. I was originally worried that the next size up would be way too big, but it fits great. The ankle strap works great for this. So far the shoes are real comfortable, and I'm very excited about wearing them in the future.",5, Khaki,15.0,13.0,0,2020
Cee Cee,Great fit for any age,  Our podiatrist recommended Crocs for our 94 year old father who needed more padding for his heels as well as a shoe that would be easy on his bunions. I was a bit hesitant thinking the popular slip on would fit too loosely and that my father would have a difficult time adjusting to this style and fit. I was wrong! Crocs are easy to slip on and off.  He‚Äôs using the heel strap and they fit perfectly. He‚Äôs the coolest great granddad and now has us wanting a new pair!,5, Black,11.0,9.0,0,2020
Allen Yanney,runs small,"  I've had a couple pair of Crocs.  Previous pair was a little big and sloppy.  I ordered the next size smaller and these are a bit too tight.  I could slip on the larger ones without touching them and they'd stay on most of the time with the strap slipping into place.  The smaller ones require a quick finger to pull the strap and then they're a little too tight at the toes.  I wish they made half sizes, but I just fall between that jump in size.  Otherwise, they're good as a slipper and a deck shoe.  They require no care and last a long time.",4, Navy,13.0,11.0,1,2018
Murph,"Fun, comfortable, saves my knees.","  I work in aquatics. I'm around pools all the time and pool decks are hard - tile on concrete or concrete. These shoes save my knees. Others must like them as deck shoes too because I see black ones all the time (I've owned 2 pair in black), but I get tired of almost putting on someone else's shoes! So, Yellow it is. I can find them easily among all the other ""men's deck shoes"" and their fun! In my job I work with a lot of kids, and they really like them too.",5, Lemon,13.0,11.0,0,2020
Emily Aiken,Received the wrong item,"  I had to go through three rounds of purchases before I got the right shoe. The first time was my fault, my boyfriend wears a 10.5 so I sized up to an 11 and that ended up being too big. So I exchanged them for a smaller size (a 10). Instead, I was given a fur lined croc (I had bought the original croc) and it was a different color. So I had to send those back and order yet another pair of crocs. They came and were the right size, color, and style. Just the same as you would buy in the store.",4, Black,12.0,10.0,0,2020
Alonzo,better than 2$ flip flops,"  I remember a friend of mine hopped onboard with these YEARS back and I completely made fun of him constantly because thats what friends do. After a few years and tons of thousands of people were wearing these things everywhere I figured they had to be good or just crazy hype. I had to try em so I grabbed a pair and I have to say they're very sturdy, comfortable, and theres better arch support vs a pair of slides. Its pretty much like boots combined with sandals? Anyways yeah I like them.",5, Slate Grey,6.0,4.0,0,2020
By the beach,Short in the toe but Oh So fun,"  Crocs are crocs, right? I finally, after years, sprung for a pair of classic crocs. I am spending time on the farm, and these are great for gardening, checking on the horses & chickens etc. so easy to clean. And in this incessant rain (thanks Harvey) I need a waterproof shoe. Size wise.... I wish  they had half sizes. I wear 8.5, but ordered 8 as suggested. Maybe I have weird toes (I admit to have broken 2). Although the toe box is roomy, my 4th and 5th toes feel uncomfortably squished. I hope that, with time, the Crocs will mold to my feet. A size up is not an option, they would be floating on me. In short: I love the color (pepper, not too red but defnitely cheery!) and the functionality.",4, Pepper,8.0,6.0,3,2017
Serious Shopper,Elder Approved,"  My mother took a bad fall on cement as she was walking with slippers/flip flops.  The flip flops folded under at the top which made her trip.  My sister bought her a pair of crocs which she uses in the house, so I bought her this pair for use outside.  She is pleased with the fit, and the color, and I'm happy that she's more secure walking...no more tripping with floppy flip flops.",5, Khaki,8.0,6.0,1,2020
Bunbury3,Light and Comfy. Do Not Leave out in the Sun!,"  These a very light, which was unexpected. I thought they would be like the old, heavy, rubber ones, but these seem to be silicone-based and are pleasantly light, bendable and comfortable. They are good for letting the errant water flow through during gardening, but of course, the open side holes also allow lots of dirt to get in, which is not as easy to get out without taking them off. That said, how hard is it to take them off? They do what they are supposed to.A word to the wise: Do not leave your Crocs out in the sun. They will shrink. These are a replacement for a men's size 9 that shrank to a women's size 7 after being in the hot sun all day. No amount of internet home remedies would fix it.",4, Tangerine,11.0,9.0,1,2017
China Doll,Buy em Sis ü•∞,  I love these shoes so much!!! Only reason I‚Äôm giving them 4 stars is because they didn‚Äôt come in an authentic crocs box they came in a plastic bag which was really disappointing. I have all my shoes organized in their original box so other than that great buy. *All charms were purchased on amazon separately* but they do make the shoes extra funky and stylish. I highly recommend üëçüèΩ,4, Lime Punch,7.0,5.0,0,2020
Dan Hoover,I don't care if you think they're ugly,"  Crocs can be life changing. They're amazing on airplanes when your feet swell on long flights. They're ridiculously comfortable. They have great arch support.  Sometimes after wearing regular shoes for a few days straight, I get really bad arch pain.  Wearing these for a day or two fixes me right up. Love them.  Note that the arch support wears out a little faster than the shoe itself, so since I wear these around the office every day, I replace them about every 4 months.",5, Khaki,15.0,13.0,0,2020
Jackie,Perfect,  It's true to size I am a woman's size 10 and it fit perfectly. I got the light blue color and it is exactly as pictured. I think the little bumps will wear down with time. I know these are ugly shoes but they are perfect for wearing poolside and in the lake in upstate New York where we have zebra mussels. these are literally my go-to outside shoe in the summer and I'm happy I finally have a pair of my own I used to steal my husband's all the time.,5, Ice Blue,10.0,8.0,0,2020
jake,works ok with plantar fasciitis,"  Was concerned that the crocs wouldn't support my feet well enough since I have bilateral plantar fasciitis. been wearing them for about a week and so far they offer ok support for both feet. Super light crocs, well made and worth the cost.  Wouldn't buy them for yeeeeeeaars because the shoes are butt-ugly...but now that I'm older and I don't care anymore, I'm glad I went ahead and bought them.",5, Slate Grey,12.0,10.0,0,2020
Mike W,The ultimate shoe for changing terrains!,"  Bought these amphibious assault shoes to craft a raft on the shore of a river out of old, downed logs. These bad boys kept my feet safe from rocks, spiders, bamboo (which would normally puncture straight through soft flesh), and broken glass. Crocs are top notch when it comes to aquatic adventuring. I highly recommend them. Not for their looks, as they're no prize pony, but for their extreme utility.",5, Slate Grey,12.0,10.0,0,2020

So I swallowed my pride and got me some crocs.OMG I sleep in them. They have become my work shoes- I paint in them, climb on the roof with them, garden in them, and cook in them. Why have I just now discovered Crocs?!?My friends make endless fun of me. They send me croc memes. I don‚Äôt why they are so tickled at my crocs, but they don‚Äôt know what they are missing.

Jenny,LOVE THEM SO MUCH but slightly big,"  I literally LOVE crocs so much. I bought a grey pair last month and having looked back since. They are slightly wider and larger than the normal shoe but it‚Äôll be great for the winter and thick socks. You do have to get used to the little beads on the bottom of the croc but honestly soooooo comfortable. Btw sport mode all the way. Get yourself a pair and be ready for the judging comments.

BookLover,Comfortable for house shoes,"  I wear these around the house b/c I have high arches and am not supposed to go barefoot very much. They don't have much arch support, so I added felt arch cookies and now they provide better support. They're a little loose but I like that, since I'm using them as house slippers.",5, Neon Purple,11.0,9.0,1,2020
D. Yauch,"Great fit, very comfortable","  I normally wear size 8.5. Usually when I get footware such as this they only come in whole sizes, so I have to choose between 8 and 9 (US). My experience has told me to go with the 8 (flip flops, muck boots, etc). It held true for these, I ordered the size 8 and fit is just what I wanted. Overall love the design, there is a bit of arch support which I want, very comfortable. I wear these as ""house slippers"" all the time I'm in the house, I live on a farm and wear boots most of the time outside, so out in the garage I leave these while stepping into my boots, and vice versa. I probably wouldn't wear these out anywhere, but you certainly could. I don't use the straps, just leave them in the out of the way position, forward, but if I did wear them any place but in the house I'd probably engage those straps.",5, Black,10.0,8.0,0,2018
Taylor Becker,Best Shoes Ever,"  I had a pair of Crocs as a kid, but never got another pair once I grew out of them. Like so many, I fell into the ""Crocs are the worst"" mindset (where it's fashionable to hate them). Having a two year old, I was looking for a pair of slip on shoes that were more comfortable than flip flops. After hours of searching, I remembered my childhood Crocs and decided to give them a chance and I'm SO glad I did. I don't even care that they look a little silly (but really not bad!) because they're so stinkin comfortable. Now I can slip them on to play outside with my daughter, run to the store, or play in the lake. They're awesome!",5, Pool,8.0,6.0,0,2020
Sue Woods,Lightweight easycare slip ons,"  I work as a volunteer with puppies, with a hygiene routine that requires me to change footwear inside and outside their pens. These are perfect for the job, being (very) lightweight, easy to disinfect and slip on and off. The back strap is useful to give added security if needed. I am an 8 1/2 (US), 39 Eur or 6.5 UK and I bought a size 9. They are easy to wear and keep on, particularly with socks, and I'm not swimming in them, as I had feared I might be.

Way too long and too wide! Next were size 12, and again no winner. Too long and too wide. Third time,(size 11), they fit! He says they are comfortable and not too long or wide, but he needs the heel strap for best fit. So... 4.5 stars for fit,(finally), and 1 star for too many trips to UPS to return. PS. All 3 pair are made in Mexico. So much for jobs for Americans! Really should deduct a star for that.",4, Slate Grey,15.0,13.0,0,2020
playmytune,Same size but fits differently,  I purchased these crocs in September 2020.  Just started wearing them today.  I assumed they would fit like the last pair I purchased because they are the same size.  I found this pair to be a little shorter ad not as wide.  I noticed this pair was made in China where as the last pair was made in Mexico.  Disappointed that this pair doesn't fit as nice ad the last pair.,5, Chocolate,8.0,6.0,0,2020
Jaliah Bryant,Gorgeous Emerald Green,  If your favorite color is green then you will love this shoe and even if it‚Äôs not you will still love it ! The green is much prettier in person. It‚Äôs like a jade/emerald green. As far as sizes go I always order a 9 but Crocs do stretch after you wear them for a while so now the shoe is more roomy! I would still recommend buying your regular size ! Because when you wear socks it will feel snug NOT tight.,5, Deep Green,9.0,7.0,0,2020
jellybean,Great for gardening & around the house,"  I have worn these since I got my first pair for 50¬¢ at a garage sale! The price on Amazon was not quite that good, but it was on the low side. I did have to return mine though because my size was not available in my desired color of khaki. Zappos had them (free shipping and free returns). As always, Amazon is my first choice, but even having to pay $6 more on Zappos.com I got the color I needed. Crocs sizing can be confusing: the bottom of each shoe list two sizes:  M (men) W (women). So when looking for your size, look for your gender size. The shoes should fit roomy at the toe and at the heal - do not let them rub anywhere (as advised by crocs). You will get used to the loose fit after a while - or just use the back strap for more stability. I ordered M 8/ W6 and it was to small (short: toe & heal touched ends) My normal shoe size is women's 8 and on rare occasion 8 1/2. My foot is narrow to med. width. The size I needed from crocs was M7/W9 (so the women's 8 was too small/short). Amazon showed my size of US7/9 (way down at the bottom of the scroll down drop-list), but did not have my color available. Thought I'd take a chance (to save $6) and try women's 8. Zappos, like Amazon, delivered quickly and the shoes in the proper size 7/9 fit!",5, Khaki,8.0,6.0,2,2014

It protects me from our cold marble floors. My feet never sweat in them. This is my second pair after 3 years and I just love them. For $30 it's the best way to pamper my feet.

Amaro D. Rossa,Cool but these spikes on the insole are a bit annoying,  I love everything about this product except for those little spikes inside. I thought Crocs were supposed to be smooth on the inside or something? Everything else is spot on. That's why I can only give 4 stars. I usually wear a size 8.5 men so I ordered an 8 and they fit perfectly! Everything else is great though. I knowwwww theses are going to bed a great investment for my knees and the little spikes inside will wear down eventually.,4, Black,8.0,6.0,0,2020

My heals would kill me at the end of the day just walking around my house since we have wood floors and tile plus our carpeted areas do not have really good padding underneath. I got these and they helped me tremendously. Sure they‚Äôre not the most appealing or fashionable.. but I still think they‚Äôre cute.

imlynnadok,Comfy but too wide,"  I returned the first pair of Crocs (unisex) that I purchased because they were ginormous. They were not only large but very wide. That said, they felt good on the sole of my arthritic feet. I went on-line again & search for a pair that was described as ""women's"" because other reviewers stated there was a definite difference in the width, ie, women's were narrower. Not so. These are just as wide. I normally wear Danskos so I'm accustomed to a shoe that fits loosely but I feel I could almost get both feet in one Croc.If you have wide feet, order the B(M)--Do NOT size up.

Lynn ,Always will have them and more than one,"  I love crocs. Have owned many, many pairs for years. And tread lasts years. I went by the chart and ordered the size it told me to, but it seemed to run larger and loose. So it's a shoe you need to first find the right size and go for it.

And the covered toe keeps them from catching is things ((which is always *my* problem with flip-flops - the toes catch and I trip)).  The back-strap is optional, but there if one needs it.

Joanne,Red not Red,  Well they are crocs. They fit well. Are comfortable as they shod be. Have been buying crocs since they came out years ago. The price is more- but so is everything else ! Will continue to buy the original crocs - they last for ever. Would have given 5 stars is the red was really red.  It is more rose than red. SO if you like the colour rose these are for you....,4, Pepper,9.0,7.0,1,2019
me,Converted croc lover!,"  I never expected to love crocs or even own a pair. After slipping into my son's beloved crocks to run out to the back yard, I was hooked. I ordered a gray pair and am very pleased with how they fit. Comfortable and functional, especially for fishing and yard work. I've also converted my mom to a croc enthusiast. She was on the fence about getting a pair, even after my dad and I told her how great they were. I surprised her on Mother's Day with a pair of her own. She was very happy with them.",5, Slate Grey,9.0,7.0,0,2020
zounds,SO COMFORTABLE-- LOVE these crocs!,"  I think these things even float! These are hands down one of the most if not the most comfortable shoe I've ever worn. No outgassing from the materials used, thankfully the company seems to be making them in a safe way with good materials (don't stop!). I no longer care if I'm teased, I love wearing crocs. Any time I do, my feet thank me for it. So let's make them hip as we de-stress & dance all day.",5, Slate Grey,9.0,7.0,1,2019
JackTheCat,Crocs rock!,"  Finding shoes that are comfortable for me has always been a total disaster due to my feet condition I was born with. My feet are wide and my Achilles tendons are not as long as they are supposed to be. My room mate suggested these crocs and while I admit I was a bit skeptical, I bought them anyways and they are literally the most comfortable thing I've ever worn. I wear them pretty much 24/7. I love them.",5, Black,12.0,10.0,0,2020
Kate,YEAH YEAH YEAH!,"  These badbois are what dreams are made of. Like walking in a gardenhose-green cloud all day.Great for kickin' round the yard or garden or simply engage 4WD and take them on rougher terrain.Love them with socks as house slippers, and after a long day of adventuring to soothe yo' barkin' dogs.You won't regret these.If you got sweaty feat... maybe not for you though.",5, Neo Mint,7.0,5.0,0,2020
Eric N. Reyes,Good original Crocs,"  These are the old original Crocs they've been selling for many years now. It was about 4-5years ago when they started making some newer Crocs with a newer type of plastic, I've bought a few pairs of those and they've all had problems with shrinking, which eventually causes them to rub and blister your foot in different places, to be expected when you buy shoes that fit, which then proceed to shrink! Don't know why they sell those ones, the material is clearly defective imo. These originals might wear out a little quicker but they're comfortable and don't shrink.",4, Chocolate,10.0,8.0,0,2019
Diane N,Beware the size,  I got three different crocs. I am usually a size 7 but I got an 8 based off of the reviews saying it comes small. I got one for myself in a size 8 and it was roomy which I like. Especially if you plan on wearing socks. I got a size 7 for a relative of mine and when I compared it with my size 8 it was extremely small! So I would recommend getting a size up. Maybe it was defected but I would rather be safe than sorry. /:,4, Black,7.0,5.0,0,2020
Alana,Wife loves them !,  I bought the Croc brand because I know they are good quality footwear. The burgundy pair we received look great. My wife says they fit perfect..not to wide..not to long..and the size is correct for the size she wears. It's hard to actually review these. She loves them and says they are very comfortable on her feet. If she wants another pair of a different color we'd order a pair of Croc's again.,5, Garnet,8.0,6.0,0,2020
Serena,Comfy and CUTE,"  I love these! When I first got them I was concerned because I thought they were too big, but found out crocs are supposed to be bigger on you! What a relief. They are so cute (I got the pink ones) and I've gotten compliments about them many times already. They are so comfortable and easy to slip on really quick. I've been wearing them every day nonstop because I LOVE them. I plan on getting more colors later on. Comfy, and cute! Totally worth it. And my package literally came the very next day after I ordered them. Super quick.",5, Ballerina Pink,8.0,6.0,0,2019
Nicholas Swanson,Great all-around comfy shoes!,"  I originally purchased these for my girlfriend for Christmas. We use Crocs to go kayaking in since they're rubber and clearly don't hold water. The only downside to using these for something like kayaking is that when the surface you're stepping on is slick, don't expect Crocs to have a firm grip - they'll make you slip easily (only downside but not enough to give 4/5 stars). We also wear crocs to go out in the spring time when the yard is just mud. That way, we can just hose the crocs off and our feet off before we go back in the house.I ordered the size shoe she usually wears and it fits her perfect without any issues. We wear these around and they are very comfortable for hours. They may not be the most fashionable shoes, but they sure are comfy.",5, Tangerine,8.0,6.0,1,2017
Ephraim Williams,Perfect!,"  I bought these because I have a broken leg and I needed shoes that were easy to put on and take off.  These fit the bill!  I bought two pairs:  one for indoors and one for outdoors.  They are comfortable, provide good support, and provide good traction.  I wear them with and without socks.For years, I hated Crocs because I thought they were a fad.  Now I'm a convert.",5, Neo Mint,13.0,11.0,0,2020
Christine B.,Amazing for post-foot surgery!!,"  No joke... I‚Äôm a first time croc buyer here, and they are so awesome!!! I broke my foot 4 months ago and had surgery and a screw put in, and once I was out of the boot I tried FOUR different styles and brands of tennis shoes, and immediately after putting them on I felt pain on the outer edge where I had surgery on my foot. Excruciating pain most of the time... I decided to try these and NO pain at all!!! I never thought I‚Äôd like crocs but I am so grateful for them now. To be able to comfortably walk is so amazing! Buy these if you have pain in your feet!! The only downside is that there aren‚Äôt 1/2 sizes..",5, Black,8.0,6.0,0,2020
Jenni F,"First purchase of crocs, didn‚Äôt disappoint!",  Love the color! I was scared to order crics without trying them on first and honestly I am glad I made the choice of buying them! They fit good and are comfy too. My first pair of crocs and I love them! I got my husband a pair in a different style (realtree camo) and he likes them too. He says they are comfy and fit nicely. The little bumps in the shoes freaked me out but it‚Äôs meant for grip when you‚Äôre feet are wet or even sweaty lol. I definitely recommend!,5, Lavender,9.0,7.0,1,2020
Sheila Lazarus,Classic Clog Croc,  A few years ago I purchased a knock off type clog croc for working in the yard.  it lasted many years and I needed to replace it.  I decided to buy the real thing this time.  It didn't disappoint.  So comfortable.  I wear them as slippers because I can go outside without having to change shoes.  Usually I wear a 7 1/2 shoe so I bought size 8 and they are perfect.,5, Slate Grey,8.0,6.0,0,2020
Eclectic,Great arch support for such light footwear,"  I only wear them around the house or yard.  I would never subject them to hardcore walking about town.I like the convenience and the arch support.I love the lightness of the Croc while wearing them, but putting them on hands-free (I'm old) is frustrating - the shoe keeps sliding forward.  I have to find a solid object (wall, stair tread, post, etc.) to stop the shoe from sliding.Trying to 'slip into' them with socks on is double-hard, since the socks snag on the little dimples, which makes the shoe slide forward that much easier.",4, Khaki,9.0,7.0,0,2019
Edna W.,Crocs Rock!,"  I absolutely LOVE the Crocs classic.  They are basically all I wear, whether I'm at work, going to a wedding (YES), gardening, at the beach, I mean:  once you go Crocs, you never go back!!!I have a C width foot, which is just a tad wider than what the shoe industry considers ""normal"" (namely a B), yet really it is right in the middle of the width spectrum.  I love that the Crocs Classics are the perfect width for me.  I love how much cushioning is between the sole of your foot and the sidewalk or whatever you are walking on.  I love that, years ago, they cured my plantar fascitis or whatever it was that caused my feet so much pain for so long--GONE, once I started wearing Crocs Classics (which were then called Crocs Caymens, but I digress--same shoe).  I love how long they last.  They are my favorite shoe on this or any other planet.",5, Khaki,8.0,6.0,3,2015
Ananda,These Deserve More Than 5 Stars!,"  These are the most comfortable shoes you could buy! I read mixed reviews about them and was a little worried about how they would fit considering I stuck to my actual size and didn‚Äôt go up/down a size. I‚Äôm a size 8w and ordered just that and they fit me perfectly!!! I also read how some people received fake ones but the ones I got are the real deal. I compared them to my friends crocs and lucky me, I received the real ones. As soon as I got them I wore them out to the store and the arch support is perfect for me because I have flat feet and wear arch supporters in my sneakers anyway. The fact they have arch support makes them 10/10!  I definitely see myself ordering more and more!! If you‚Äôre thinking about getting these, just do it! You will not regret it I promise you.",5, Lavender,8.0,6.0,0,2020
Rosso,These Shrink considerably if left in strong sunlight; buy 1-2 sizes larger.,"  Mostly I wanted to note to others that if left or worn a lot in the sunlight, THESE WILL SHRINK CONSIDERABLY.I first bought 14's,  but at season's end, they were too small for me to wear.I bought these 16's and at the end of this hot Summer, they are just about right for me.One of my feet is a 15, the other a 14.Takes some time for these to shrink, so you'll have to suffer through some floppiness, or wear thick socks until the shrink to fit.",4, Chocolate,18.0,16.0,1,2018
C,They're Crocs and silly,"  We all know Crocs are silly. I bought these sort of on a whim as a joke. But now that I work from home a lot, I wear them every day. Good indoor shoes, good outdoor shoes. And they are very comfortable. I don't wear them out in public, but I have a feeling one day I'll stop caring what people think and just go for it. When they wear out, I'll probably buy some more.",5, Navy,12.0,10.0,0,2020
LStrut,People will make fun of you,"  Let's be honest, you have to have some kind of sense of humor rocking these shoes. The main thing, these are the most comfortable shoes ever and can I mention safe?! I was hanging at the river and one of my gal pals was really giving me a hard time about wearing crocs, meanwhile she blew out her old navy flip flop and rocked her face on some ground and all I had to say was how sturdy and waterproof these crocs were on my feet as I blew past her for another beer.",5, Lemon,6.0,4.0,0,2020
Avid Reader,I'd no idea how important it was to have these.,"  One of my sons had a neat pair of some inexpensive rubbery shoes and I asked him to get me a pair. Dissatisfied with them I bought myself some Crocs instead. Thinking I'd have them by the front door to slip on when I got the mail or took out the trash, which usually mean walking out in the rain, and the Crocs were a decent no slip foot gear. But I'd no idea that I'd suddenly be hit by major emergency surgery and couldn't bend, and my feet swelled up! The Crocs were very important, heck, are still important in getting to my medical appointments during recovery!",5, Black,12.0,10.0,0,2018
Thomas Stamper,Surprisingly Comfortable,"  My wife has had a pair of crocs for 10 years and I never considered joining her.  I have never liked sandals.  I like flip flips even less.  Crocs looked uncomfortable to me.  I finally gave in because I needed something on my feet that could get wet.  Boy was I surprised at how comfortable these things are.  What looks like hard plastic is unexpected cushion.  Pressure washing, cleaning pool filters, or just taking out the trash is easy and I'm not worried about the mess.  I should have bough a pair of these a long time ago.",5, Black,13.0,11.0,0,2019
Iggy W.,"Lightweight, Comfortable, Runs About Half Size Small","  I ordered these to use on my deck, filling bird feeders, etc.  They are perfect for this purpose.  Easily washed, and super lightweight.  If you think you will have a decent walking shoe, not so much.  There is just about no support whatsoever, but I didn't expect it.  I normally wear a 7 to a 7 and a half in women's, and I guess right in ordering an 8.  These are made in China, and so run smaller.  Order carefully!",5, Neon Purple,8.0,6.0,0,2020
JJW,Buy SMALLER than usual size,"  Love crocks!  Everyone in my whole family wears them but you must buy a smaller size.  If you are a 1/2 size then order a size down for sure.  My boyfriend is size 10 1/2 and we got him a 9.  I am a 6 1/2 and a 6 works for me.  If you are ordering on prime then perhaps get 2 sizes and return one of them.  Other than the size being large, these are great shoes for lounging.",5, Cobblestone,11.0,9.0,0,2020
LDK,Comfort Over Style!,"  I know this fad is probably already over, but I just decided to finally buy a pair in anticipation of a cruise. I'm not crazy about the texture that you put your feet on (a little spiky), but I got used to it. I am picky about my footwear, and there are few things I can wear without the soles of my feet hurting. These things are SO comfortable! They are super lightweight and seriously the only footwear I needed for the entire week on the cruise. I wore them in the room, walking around the ship, walking around ports, to the beach, to the pool, and even to dinner. The last is maybe not recommended, but you can definitely get away with it. :) I even tried to continue wearing them once I got back to the Minnesota snow (although that did not work out so well). I like the black color because they blend in a little bit more than the brighter colors. They do get crease marks on the top of them, but there's not really a way to prevent that. You might lose a few style points, but they are so comfortable you will not even care!",5, Black,11.0,9.0,1,2015

Amazon Customer,True to size,  I am a shoe size 8. I bought a size 8 and it fit my foot exactly. I returned them and bought a size 9 instead because I wanted to have a little extra room in my Crocs.

Makieyaa shirley,"Size up, fits differently than the average crocs.","  Overall a really great and sturdy product. I noticed that these crocs were a tad smaller than the ones I‚Äôve actually purchased in the crocs store. I don‚Äôt know why I felt this way, but something about these and the other ones I‚Äôve purchased; even though they‚Äôre the same size, seemed smaller. I would definitely recommend sizing up.

Kokomo Mike,Excellent Quality Product,  Purchased my first pair at an Outlet Mall about 5 years ago and paid almost twice the amount for the same thing.  I used to wear them around the house inside and out.  They finally needed replaced after a small hole got worn into the sole.  They held up very well for a long time.  Probably should have been replaced a year ago but even 4 years of wear and tear is pretty good for rubber shoes.  These new ones fit just like the old ones.  The only noticeable difference is the back heel portion is a bit shorter than my original pair.  Excellent Product.,5, Chocolate,13.0,11.0,0,2018

Normally, I order off of the website but I decided to order through amazon. I ordered the chambray blue color in a size 9 (I am in between sizes so I sized up since my other crocs were a 9). I could have easily worn an 8 and I kinda wished I had ordered an 8. My other crocs fit very relaxed and tight to my foot which I like. These crocs, however, are much roomier and a little hard to walk in. All in all, good shoe and cute color. Just make sure that you know ahead of time that these are extremely roomy.",4, Chambray Blue,9.0,7.0,1,2020

Eah Waggs,Swollen hot pregnancy feet relief,"  First time croc buyer...pretty much what I expected. Not a ton of support, my feet were a little sore after being on them all day at work, but that is typical with a new shoe. I bought these due to swelling feet during the end of this pregnancy, and these are perfect for that. Lots of air flow to keep my feet cool, but still a closed toe shoe that is required in my medical office job. I bought a 9 US Womens, I usually wear a 8.5 (39 euro size) but my feet have definitely changed during this second pregnancy. Lengthwise I feel like I would want a little more room, but width wise they are plenty big and I know I would swim in the next size up.",4, Navy,9.0,7.0,0,2018

She wears Birks all summer but, come fall, these are her jam for the rest of the year.For her, comfort beats style so you'll never catch her in a pair of heels like my younger daughter wears constantly.

Prime delivery was not available when I ordered, so it felt like it took a long time to get them, over a week. And in 2020, 10 days to receive something is way too long. But overall, very happy with the purchase... Cheaper than Crocs.com üòÉ",5, White,8.0,6.0,0,2020
Annie,Good except fits small,  Good except fits small.  I have other Crocs shoes that are size 7 and they fit way looser.  These fiot more like a 6 I have to push the ankle strap forward on these size 7 Crocs in order to feel more comfortable  They are a bit short.  i like the color its cool looking but I think the Baya Croc clogs are sturdier and better quality and the 7 fits way looser in that style.  The material on this Croc is softer than the Baya so not as sturdy for outdoor walking etc.  in my opinion.,4, Khaki,7.0,5.0,1,2018
AH,Why haven‚Äôt you bought these yet?,"  This is my go to choice for footwear. I‚Äôve worn these to work, to fish, to hike, to kayak, trips to Walmart even playing in the yard with the dog. Honestly if you‚Äôre one of those people that question if these are worth the money... odds are you are missing out on a lot of other aspects in life. These are an all around shoe, that will float if lost in the water AND you can wear them in the shower to clean them! I plan on buying some fuzzy ones as well as flats for church.",5, Black,7.0,5.0,0,2019
Edrick,Pretty fashionable... for Crocs.,"  I should have bought two pair for when the first pair wear out.  Unlike most Crocs I wear, people do not look at these disapprovingly.  The style of these has gotten a lot of positive attention and feedback.  More than one person has said, ""Are those your Pink Floyd Crocs?""  LOL!Anyway, although they're just Crocs, the stylishness of these tends to kick things up a notch from just plain 'ol solid colored Crocs.  In other words... I'm almost afraid to say it... they're a little more fashionable than regular Crocs.  Other than the style, they fit and function just like standard Crocs.",5, Black,8.0,6.0,1,2017
Richard Chamberlain,Great footwwear for Aqua-Aerobics Exercise,  Crocs dry very quickly because they don't absorb water as many neoprene water shoes do.  This is important to me because I go five times a week to aqua-aerobics exercise programs and I need the shoes to dry before my next session.  I also like the color selection of Crocs.  I was able to get a color to match my bathing suit.,5, Ice Blue,10.0,8.0,2,2018
Lauri S.,"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!","  These are GREAT. Don't know why I resisted getting crocs for so long... I guess I thought they were ugly, but man, are they ever comfortable!! And I've gotten to the point in my life where comfort trumps style. (That being said, they aren't THAT ugly... Or maybe they've just grown on me!) I had an old pair of slides that I used for quick indoor/outdoor shoes (to take out the trash, etc.), but they developed holes in the soles, and needed to be replaced. These fit the bill perfectly! I can quickly slip them on to go outside, then slide them off in my foyer when I come back inside (especially with the strap swiveled up an out of the way, they function like clogs).They fit as expected (sizes run true).",5, Black,7.0,5.0,1,2017
Amazon Customer,Great Shoes!,  I love my crocs. I bought them to have an easy pair of shoes to slip on when going around my dorm building and they are perfect! They are amazing. Just be aware that if you for whatever reason may want the back support in the back and not the front that they may be a little tight. I personally do not wear them that way but when trying them out I figured out they were a little snug on my feet if the back part was in the back and not the front.,5, Garnet,7.0,5.0,0,2020
blasianbroad,Crocs are convenient comfortable,  I‚Äôve been wanting crocs for years and I am a 10 in women‚Äôs. 8.5 in men‚Äôs. I don‚Äôt play with my feet. The crocs 8/10 that I have tried on always seem like it‚Äôs a 9.5.  So  i broke down I went with the 9/11 which is a 9/11. Bc it‚Äôs too big for me.8/10 is in accurate but I love crocs. I have a pair of wedges which are cute and crazy comfortable,5, Pepper,11.0,9.0,0,2020
Patchouli Patty,Comfort and Quality,"  True Croc! The first thing I noticed was that the inside sole is textured with soft bumps that massage the bottom of my feet. They are just so comfortable. And this green is true green. I really wanted to get the tie dyed, but when I read the reviews I was afraid it was just painted on. The green is solid, not painted, like John Deere Green...I love em!",5, Deep Green,9.0,7.0,0,2020
Jess,Mom loves these! They are cute and comfy :),"  Was looking for some comfortable slip on shoes for my mom who is a little older, at first I wasn't sure these would be good for her but she tried mine on and mentioned how she would love to have a pair of these.  She purchased some similar off brand but they were not what she wanted, I ended getting her two pairs and she absolutely loves them.",5, Ballerina Pink,6.0,4.0,0,2020
A. Russell,Comfy but runs small,"  Love Crocs sandals. They're super light weight and fairly durable considering they're just made of foam. They're some of the more comfortable sandals I own, since they have some arch support and whatnot in them. I still couldn't wear them for a whole day, or even several hours at once, but for brief periods, like to run outside or wear at the beach, they're great. I only have 1 complaint, they tend to run about 2 sizes too small. I wear a 9- 9.5 regularly, but had to order a 12 in Crocs so they'd fit comfortably.",4, Black,14.0,12.0,0,2019
CWBaker,Foam footwear for the win!,"  They‚Äôre dorky, but wow my feet have never been happier! There‚Äôs a reason they‚Äôre so popular. I‚Äôve been happy with my Crocs for years and glad I no longer do off brands that don‚Äôt last nearly as long.I have an indoor pair and outdoor pair and if I‚Äôm not wearing shoes, I‚Äôm wearing Crocs! They literally help me walk and stand for long periods because in normal shoes, my pinched nerve in my back acts up.",5, Black,12.0,10.0,0,2020
Amazon Customer,Good for Wearing Plastic,"  I can't believe the shoes are back ""in style""....my husband and I can't believe we paid close to $40 for our child to wear plastic (Thermoplastic) shoes. That aside, my daughter loves them and wears them everywhere and cleans them nightly and they come clean easily. I like the color for her and she loves it....just can't believe the price for what they are....it's like jelly shoes from the 80's on steroids....and way higher priced than they were for their time period.",4, Black,8.0,6.0,0,2019
TJL2,Crocs Forever,"  I have been wearing Crocs for years. I have several pairs now - different colors for different wardrobes!They are the most comfortable footwear I own. Easy on/off is a plus. I even have pairs lined with ""faux fur"" for winter wear. Easily a 5 star rating!",5, Slate Grey,13.0,11.0,2,2020
Lauren,Comfy around the house,"  I can‚Äôt believe I waited until I was 28 years old to own a pair of these majestic feet cushions. My slippers kept wearing out so I wanted to treat myself to something slip-on and comfortable. When you have hardwood floors, cold tile, and dog hair everywhere, bare feet is not a good option. These Ice Blue Crocs are the answer to my feet woes and happily squeak around the house in them.",5, Ice Blue,9.0,7.0,0,2020
Lucas Ouimet,Quality you would expect from Crocs!,"  These are exactly what you expect them to be, I use these to mow, take the trash can down, or simply just outside in the yard. They work fantastic for many reasons and one of the main reasons being that they are impossible to stain. They have great airflow and definitely recommend these for the ultimate around the house shoe!",5, Black,16.0,14.0,0,2020
mama of 3,Great for RA Comfort and Protection,"  I bought these for a family member that has RA that primarily affects their feet. They are always looking for a house slipper type shoe that offers support, comfort, and protection, but is gentle on their feet. These shoes fit the bill! They LOVE these and say that their feet feel protected and comfortable. They fit true to size and have been very durable (they don't wear them outside though).",5, Navy,12.0,10.0,0,2020
Jess,My sore feet thank these atrocious clown shoes,"  I usually wear a womens 8.5 in regular shoes but after reading reviews sized down to an 8. The 8 fits perfectly without looking too big or clownish. While my co-workers mock my clown shoes, they are the only thing saving my feet from burning after 8 hour shifts of standing and running around. Would recommend to anyone who has to stay on their feet a lot or simply wants comfortable shoes! :) They do feel better if you wear thicker socks. Thinner socks can make the rubber feel uncomfortable against your feet after standing for an hour or two.",5, Navy,8.0,6.0,0,2020
Garlic Powder,I love these ugly shoes!,"  I got these simply because they were on sale and I wanted something I could slip on at home and wear around the house.These are super comfortable. Everyone knows that Crocs are comfortable. That‚Äôs the whole point of Crocs.Since they‚Äôre super ugly, I wouldn‚Äôt wear them around town...but I knew they were ugly when I ordered them. They‚Äôre perfect for what I need them for. I love these ugly little fellows!",5, Navy,10.0,8.0,1,2019
Li'Mae Essentials,Love them,"  These are my first real pair of crocs.  Never had the need for them as I don't work in health care.  I do however run my own printing business of which I am on my feet most of the day and with my sicatic nerve issues, I was looking for something comfortable.  These did the job!  I even have arch support which is crazy!  Will be buying another pair soon.",5, Black,10.0,8.0,0,2020
Alexis,Know Your Size,"  Update: a week later I definitely just need to wear them for a little while and they are perfect definitely the best pair for the priceThese are my first pair of crocs so I was not sure what to expect as far as sizes for. I have been told that they run smaller or true to size, so I just went with my normal size which is US Women 8. They are a bit small length wise maybe I just need to break them in or I possibly just have too fat of a foot. Bright side they are comfy and true in color",5, Melon,8.0,6.0,0,2020
Dana O,Best Gardening shoes ever,"  Let's be honest, these things are hideous, even though they are the cutest shade of pink ever. I only wear them when gardening (in the Texas heat). They are easy to slip on, clean, and are sturdy enough to go trekking around in the grass. Very supportive, and have had zero complaints so far. I hose them off at the end of my gardening sessions and store them in the garage.",5, Blossom,7.0,5.0,0,2020
Diana Banana,YOU CAN FEEL IT IN YOUR SOLE!,"  The Croslite Polymer rubber-like material is extremely soothing to your feet. I use these as slippers indoors. They keep your feet cool in the summer and warm in the winter. As soon as I walk in the door, I step into these. These shoes RELAX your feet big time! You can wear the strap in the front or the back. I wear it in the back to secure my heel. You can also use them at the beach to protect your feet from glass, rocks, & sea weed. These Crocs are the first item I put in my suitcase no matter where I'm going. You can throw them in the washing machine and they quickly air dry. You can also hose them off. They are my 2nd feet! I wear them all the time I am inside my house (except when I'm sleeping) because they feel so comfortable. These Crocs last for years! The value greatly exceeds the price and you will save hundreds of dollars on slippers if you use them in their place. I highly recommend them!",5, Tangerine,9.0,7.0,0,2020
Samson,So comfy,  I LOVE my crocs! It‚Äôs been hard to wear other shoes lately haha I find myself just wanting to throw these on every time I leave the house! I‚Äôve had these for a couple months now and they have held up great for me! I saw a lot of reviews say the quality isn‚Äôt as great as it once was but I was satisfied with the product I received! Just ordered a pair in a different color!,4, Army Green,8.0,6.0,0,2020
Jessica Horton,Cute and super comfy,  For me these fit great and are super comfortable. I have very wide feet. I wear an 8.5 4E and have so much trouble finding shoes that fit but these are just right let alone that come in so many cute colors. I have moderate arch and these provide great support. I have worn them walking and on bike rides and my feet have been very happy.,4, Army Green,9.0,7.0,0,2020
Julie Chamberlain,Comfortable and protects my feet from our killer attack kitten.,  Bought these to protect my feet from the killer attack kitten we recently adopted. I forgot how comfortable Crocs are and I‚Äôve been enjoying wearing them around the house. I do have a medical issue that causes my feet to swell so these shoes do accommodate for the swelling. I love the color and have been enjoying rockin the Crocs again!,5, Neo Mint,13.0,11.0,0,2020
FitnessGal,Good quality!  Good Price!,"  My daughter plays high school softball and these are the go to shoes for after and before games.

KING OF NEW YORK HACKS,CROCS !!! Is the hype true ?!?!,"  Fits well, first time Crocs owner so will try to do an update in a month or so after they are broken in. After reading the reviews I was hoping for American made but got ""Made in Vietnam"". Other sites said that's a good thing, we shall see. So far they fit perfect, a little room for the big toe and both my feet are surprisingly comfortable being they just came out of the bag. Feels like a slipper and the motion of my feet react just like they do with slides, however when I pull the Crocs strap back, both feet are snug and grip the ground firmly much more than I anticipated. Will test on wet floors, beach, hot tar, and concrete. Any other tests anyone wants done let me know and maybe I'll experiment with them. I'll do an update review in a month or sooner if they wind up being my summer go to shoe. Giving 5 starts because so far everything promised was given from quick delivery to a proper fit. Will change if things don't work out, but for now Crocs is living up to the hype.",5, Navy,13.0,11.0,0,2019
Amazon Customer,My feet thank whoever designed Crocs!,"  I have wide feet that spread out at the toe.  Therefore, Croc's roomy toe area is just perfect for me.  They are VERY comfortable and I would recommend them to anyone.  If you get a pair you'll be doing yourself a favor.",5, Slate Grey,11.0,9.0,1,2020
Lauren M,"All I wear now. If you think they're ugly, give them a chance!","  Thoroughly impressed with these. I didn't have a strong opinion of these before I purchased (most people think ugly). I was looking for something to wear anywhere and everywhere, which these are fantastic for. They stay on my feet and don't flop around, slide on easily, lightweight, comfortable, breathable, easy to clean, the list goes on and on! Also worth mentioning, I suffer from Lupus and wake up in the morning stiff as a board. These make my mornings so much easier not having to bend down and fuss with putting shoes/slippers on. As far as the aesthetics of these, doesn't bother me at all! The benefits far outweigh the appearance of these so just give them a chance.",5, Blossom,9.0,7.0,0,2020
Monica Garcia,Approved!,"  I used to have the Baya Clogs and those were definitely more wide and sort of more comfortable for lounging around. These regular clogs are great if you‚Äôre gonna do some walking. They are more slim so if you have a more narrow foot get these but if you have a more wider foot I would say get the Baya clog. Overall great quality :) just don‚Äôt leave them out in the sun because they WILL shrink, learned my lesson haha.",5, Melon,9.0,7.0,0,2020
Maria A.,Ugly shoe that I had sworn not to wear but bought and now wear anyway!,"  Our adult son showed my husband his Crocs and then he tried them on.  My husband then bought them and loves them.  Then I had to go outside to get the mail and I didn't want to go back into my closet so I wore my husband's Crocs out to the mail box.  Oh my gosh, they were comfy for these flat feet, so now I own 2 pair.  This one and the winter ones that have fuzzy material inside them.  I wear them with socks on so that the soles don't smell and will keep longer.",5, Black,10.0,8.0,0,2020
Amazon Customer,These are awesome!,"  These are a must-have for me.  After my husband threw my old ones in the dryer ( I wash them with the rags), they shrunk too much to be able to wear them.  I had to order another pair right away as I love these for slippers after being on ladders all day.  The cushioning is just glorious and makes my feet feel so much better.",5, Ballerina Pink,9.0,7.0,1,2019
Donald Gillette,Better Than Expected,"  I was hesitant to buy these for a couple of reasons.  First, they're...you know--rubber? Plastic? Something like that...  Second, they're...you know--not masculine? Kind of sissified? Finally, the picture makes them look flimsy. So okay. Yes--they are some kind of man-made rubber/plastic/neoprene/something, but that makes them waterproof meaning you can leave them out on the deck after you've been working in the yard and you don't have to worry about them getting soggy and ruined. No--they're not the most masculine shoes I've ever seen, so you have to be pretty confident in your manhood if you wear them out on the town but I got them for yard work which is a fairly macho enterprise. And no, they're not as flimsy as the pictures look. I don't know how long that heel-strap thing will last, but I don't use it half the time anyway and for some reason, your feet don't slip out of the shoes without it, so if it does break--Super Glue and duct tape. THEN they'll look masculine!",5, Chocolate,13.0,11.0,3,2013
Kela b,Great Product,  Great fit and so comfortable! I was having a problem with pain in my heel and these shoes was the perfect remedy. I will be ordering more in several different colors.,5, White,8.0,6.0,1,2020
Barb,Very comfortable.,  I bought the USA women's size 8. Normally I wear an 8 1/2 shoe. This clog fits snug but not too tight. I like that the back strap can be worn over your heel or flipped up to the front out of the way. This does have little knobby things inside but I wear low ankle socks with mine so I don't feel them. The soles are very cushiony and have good tread so I don't slip on uneven ground. Very pleased.,5, White,8.0,6.0,0,2019
DJW,Like a Foot Massage Every Time I wear Them,"  I purchased these to wear around the house because I have been having lot's of heel pain and can't walk barefoot anymore.  These shoes are a life saver.  I never owned Crocs before.  My son purchased a pair with the fussy liners and he really liked them.  I didn't want the extra warmth so I purchased these.  I am so impressed.  And I can go outside in them if I want.  Part of the reason for my headline about ""foot massage"", is the soles have small ridges of dots that actually massage my foot.",5, Navy,12.0,10.0,0,2019

But as I‚Äôve gotten older I‚Äôve seen the time and place for them (newsflash it‚Äôs not everywhere). Power washing patio: yup. Walking out to the garage/yard to do some stuff: yup. Basement: uh-huh. Welding/grinding: negatory. Leaving the house to go into public: still a big nope... for now.",5, Navy,12.0,10.0,0,2020

James Lande,The website is nice and there are all kinds of options,"  I used to have heel pain --  plantar fascia.  I stretched a couple times a day and that mostly kept the pain at bay.  Then a friend suggested crocs.  Pain gone.  It has been 10 years since I have worn anything else -- or stretched.  I used to these shoes direct from Crocs.  The website is nice and there are all kinds of options.  Almost all of the styles that I tried were narrower.  My 'real shoe' size is 11 EEE.  Crocs Mens 12 work in this style.  If they feel a little tight at first, keep wearing them.  They stretch and, like fine leather shoes, mold to the feet.  Amazon Prime means free shipping, so I can buy one pair at a time without paying shipping and for the same price as the Crocs website or the local box store.And if you take a worn out pair and slice them up, they make fine sanding blocks.",5, Black,14.0,12.0,0,2016
Pupnasty,Why are they so comfortable?,"  You know you've gone full adult when crocs are super comfortable and you wear them around the house.

Andrea Kalli,The perfect gardening shoes for plantar fasciitis inserts,"  These are exactly what I needed them to be. Comfortable,  waterproof, easy on/off shoes for me to wear when doing yard work. If they were a half size larger I would say they're perfection. Other than that, these are wonderful.  I need to always wear shoes or inserts for plantar fasciitis,  and the heel bed in these shoes is deep enough for me to slip some right in and they stay in place. I've now tossed out my old tennis shoes I was wearing for garden work.",5, Khaki,8.0,6.0,0,2019
H A Theodora,Like that they haven‚Äôt changed a thing in the design,"  Bought this pair to replace the ones my dad has had for 8 years and they are exactly the same as far as fit, design and comfort. He has wide feet and this style fits him perfectly. I‚Äôm glad to see that this design has stayed the same over the years. I tried his on and didn‚Äôt realize how much better these (comfort and tread) were vs my slippers for around the house. Needless to say, I‚Äôll be purchasing my own.",5, Navy,9.0,7.0,0,2020
Northeastern Girl,Great for support when quarantined!,  After a month of mandatory COVID work from home my lower back would kill at the end of the day from not wearing shoes all day. I hate wearing shoes when I‚Äôm home but needed support for my back. These did the trick. They are loose so you don‚Äôt feel like you have shoes on but give my lower back the support it needs.

Amzoony,Good traction,"  They provide reasonable support and are slip proof.  The size 7 I usually wear is slightly snug with these; I would be happier with a 7.5 if they had half sizes.  The holes are nice because they let your feet breath.  I wear socks with them because the inside feels slightly prickly (little nubs).  (Note:  I edited my review and gave it a higher rating after a few days because they are very different and take some getting used to.  For standing and doing chores, they are pretty comfortable).",4, Khaki,7.0,5.0,0,2019

Nicolette Ras,Crocs Exceeded My Expectations,"  I was the type of person that believed Crocs were very uncomfortable, so I never bought a pair of Crocs. However, a friend of mine owns about 7 pairs of Crocs and swears they are the most comfortable pairs of shoes. I tried on one of hers, and they were extremely comfortable, so I bought a pair of my own. I am very impressed with the price, comfort, and ease of these shoes. They are perfect for slipping on and going, and if they get dirty from being outside, they wipe clean very easily.",5, White,8.0,6.0,1,2020
Katie Davis,Comfortable and easy to wear.,"  I made fun of my daughters white crocs SO MUCH until I put hers on jokingly and was like WHOA WAYAMINUTE. They are so comfortable. I bought mine in black so that I can wear them at work. Only one of my coworkers has made fun of me so I'd say its a WIN WIN! I am a total old lady tho and I keep the backs on mine.

Colette Imbeau,Comfy!,  I really like these for my yard work. They have good support and are comfortable to wear for the day. I did go for a 3 mile walk in them and it gave me little blisters on the top of my foot as crocs are not designed to be form fitting and so they rubbed a bit...so I would just wear socks with them if I plan on walking a long time in them. I really like them regardless.,4, Chocolate,7.0,5.0,0,2020
Steven White,Bigfoot likes um!,  Well... I never had a pair of Crocs before. Somebody told me they used to be softer. I like the Crocs a lot. They are a tad wide but I expected that. They are my new go to shoes this Summer. I have a size 15 foot. I was just amazed that I could get them in a size-15 for $30. I bought my daughter a pair and they were $10 more for the same basic style. .. Go figure? Glad I got them. They will be a great Summer/house shoes for me. Flip flops are not made for guys with a size 15 foot. These crocs have got to be the next best thing to flip flops..... maybe better.,5, Navy,17.0,15.0,0,2018

That's ok, should go good with my hean shorts.",5, Navy,10.0,8.0,0,2020
Lindsey ,"Ugly, but comfy","  For the longest time, ever since they came out really, I thought Crocs were the ugliest shoes. I couldn't see why anybody wore them. However, my boyfriend owns a pair, and I had to wear them a few times (granted his feet are quite bigger than mine). They. Are. Comfortable. As. Heck. It took a while, but I finally decided that I needed to buy a pair of my own. My feet hurt all the time, especially my heels because that's where I put all of my weight when standing. Let me tell you: I can walk around for hours wearing these shoes, and I don't feel any discomfort. Even after a 9-hour shift of standing and walking around at work, I can put these on, and my feet already feel better. Do yourself a favor and buy yourself a pair. I wear 8 1/2, so I dropped down a half size as recommended, and they fit perfectly.",5, Black,8.0,6.0,0,2018

A1ru1k0n9,Keep wearing it to loosen over time,"  I love these clogs!!! I still have my old pair since 2004! I bought a new pair just in case my old pair might fail.I was reading some of the reviews here stating that the clog is a tight fit. It's only tight because it hasn't been worn and it's brand new. Once you keep wearing it, it'll loosen over time.",5, Slate Grey,7.0,5.0,0,2020
LovelyDesa,My Third Pair!,"  I wear a size 9 1/2 in women‚Äôs ordered a 10 in the Navy and they are perfect. These are my third pair along with the Croc sandals.

I got Prime so they were delivered the next day.",5, Navy,10.0,8.0,0,2020
SelHer,Great!,"  Got it for a friend of mine. She loves the color and the fit was all right. She did tell me that sometimes her toes would occasionally touch/hit the toe part of the crocs, but if she goes to a size higher, it would be too big for her. She doesn't mind it too much though! The price is good for the fact that crocs are $50+.",5, Black,10.0,8.0,1,2020
Cheryl,Great prouduct,"  Pros-  Good in the water. really comfortable, no pain in your foot, you can decorate themCons- A little roomy, I personally don't think its a problem but some people don't like that. it sticks to your feet if they get sweatyIn conclusion, great water shoes for the beach or good shoes for chilling around at home. 100% recommend for anyone looking for a multifunctional pair of shoes that they can decorate",5, Black,8.0,6.0,0,2020
Beloved,Can't live without them!,"  I had a pair of these that I had worn almost every day for 6+ years that somehow got lost during a hospital stay.  I was so sad ... and immobilized, as these shoes are what I wear around my house every day while I chase my kiddos and do chores!  If I don't wear them my feet hurt so badly.  After a week or so of going barefoot and not wearing them I ended up with a full limp and a sore knee (from walking funny because of my foot pain).  My husband couldn't stand it anymore and told me to order another pair PRONTO!  I did, and within a day my feet felt great again!  I have incredibly high arches, and these are one of the few types of shoes I can wear for extended periods of time without any pain.  I loooove my crocs!!",5, Black,10.0,8.0,1,2016
Mike O. ,4x4 Capable - Comfortable Design,"  Very comfortable footwear that is perfect to have by the back door of you go in and out of the house frequently. They feel good on the bottom of your feet because of the bumpy pattern of the shoe that contacts your sole. They stay on great, and if you need more security you can flip over the strap and put them in four wheel drive mode. I typically wear a 13, or sometimes a 12 1/2 of a shoe manufacturer even makes it, but in these I wear a 12. If your feet sweat, you might find they sweat more in these. However, my feet seem to be getting use to them and seem to be sweating less the more that I wear them. They are a great product, designed well, and seem robust enough to last for years. I would definitely recommend.",5, Slate Grey,14.0,12.0,0,2020
AStewart,Love them,"  I always thought crocs were goofy. But I'm the kind of person whose feet feel better if I wear shoes in the house, especially if I'm standing in my kitchen cooking for long periods of time, or doing other chores around the house. These are excellent for that. So comfortable and cushy. Love the purple color too.",5, Lavender,8.0,6.0,0,2020
Nicole,I would buy another pair,"  Brought these to slip on if I need to run errands quick and for the summer to wear when I go on a boat or to the beach. These are perfect for all of those things. You won‚Äôt be disappointed. Even though I would have liked if these came in half sizes due to the fact that when you put the strap on in the back, your foot is pushed literally to the top of the shoe which to me isn‚Äôt uncomfortable, but I know for some individuals it may be. I also like a little bit of a looser fit. But other than that, I couldn‚Äôt be happier with this buy!",5, Lavender,7.0,5.0,1,2020
Terri Fluhart,"Crocs are wide and fit well. They are true to size, though, and last forever","  Living on an island just 60 feet from the water, my everyday shoes are flip flops and Crocs!

Unfortunately I don't enjoy working in them, I do not find them comfortable for standing and walking all day.I do find them comfortable for house shoes though.

MARK,Fourth or fifth pair.,  Nothing says relaxing at the house like a good pair of crocs. I would not suggest pairing them with a suit and tie but for passive walks through Walmart and Dollar General they cannot be beat. Easy to clean with a water hose. Haven‚Äôt had to put these bad boys in 4x4 yet but I have no doubt they will perform as their predecessors have.,5, Black,16.0,14.0,0,2020
Anne Mills,Happy Convert,"  Finally gave in, and I love them -- I have resisted crocs for many years, because they look, to be brutal, stupid.  But we spend the winter on the beach, and I got tired of ruining at least two pairs of white sandals a year by getting them wet when I was totally sure I wouldn't.  So: crocs.  The reviews left me frightened of mis-sizing, so I shot an arrow in the air and ordered an eight, which fits perfectly.  They are comfortable on the beach, comfortable around the house, and comfortable when we go out on errands.  Mine are white, and they have stayed dazzlingly clean looking.  On the downside, they do accumulate debris, and the do look -- stupid.  But noone is asking me to wear them on Madison Avenue, and for a beach community, they are just great.",5, White,10.0,8.0,2,2015

So these are just my leisure slippers.",5, Lavender,8.0,6.0,0,2020
Tina Gerlach,Ordered for my elderly father with swollen feet,"  I ordered this pair of crocs for my 80 year older father as a safer and more supportive option to slippers for those days that his feet are swollen.My father's legs and feet swell, so he tends to wear open back slippers because of the ease of putting them on when his feet swell, however, there is no support and they are a fall risk since they can easily fall off his feet.  The crocs on the other hand are a roomy, solid option for when his feet swell and the air holes help to keep his feet cool, unlike shoes. The back strap keeps them on his feet, thus keeping him safer.",5, Slate Grey,13.0,11.0,0,2020

Jana Braaksma,"Strap down, Size up!!!","  These are of course super comfortable but beware the strap (see picture) makes them about a size smaller than my normal croc size. For some reason with the white crocs the strap comes in almost a whole inch from the back of the shoe. So if you rock socks and crocs and/or like the strap down to lock in the shoe, your toe will rub in the front if you get your normal size. Which I found uncomfortable. Thankfully Amazon has great returns and I was able to get the best fitting size. Normal size men‚Äôs 11 I went up to men‚Äôs 12 and fit great.",4, White,14.0,12.0,0,2020

No more toe pain. The toe box has plenty of room. I usually wear a 7.5-8 In sneakers so I ordered the 8 in these shoes. As long as I don‚Äôt wear them with the strap around my ankle they are a perfect fit. With the strap, my big toes are right up against the top. If I ordered again, I might consider a 9 so I can wear them with straps.",4, Black,8.0,6.0,1,2020

JG,If you want happy feet Crocs are the answer!,"  This is my third pair of Crocs because they are crazy comfortable.  I suffer with metatarsalgia capsulitis and if you know that name you know how painful it is.  I can no longer walk bare footed and  I was upset about this until I was reintroduced to Crocs which make this much less of a hardship.

Stew,Worked well on military deployment. Durable and comfortable,"  I wore these at least once a day for 9 months on my last military deployment. I highly recommend them if you need ""shower shoes."" I wore these in the shower, in my berthing, and even walking through the Kuwaiti desert to get to the bathroom. They've been folded, smushed, and packed multiple times in my pack and they don't seem to show any signs of breaking. One thing a lot of people might not realize is that they're thicker than regular flip flops and will protect your feet from bacteria better. I seriously think everyone should use these instead of those cheap, black $1 flip flops you get at the PX. I wear a size 11 in most footwear, but these were maybe a half size too big. I didn't really mind this because they were easy to slip on and off.",5, Khaki,13.0,11.0,2,2014

In addition they had been worn through on the soles.The first moment he put them on he was so happy. The crocs actually fit extremely well no looseness although I had ordered a size 11 and he normally wears a 10.5. There are bumps\ridges on the inside that massaged his feet.He took the dog on their usual walk 2 miles wearing the crocs.When he returned the shoes had become his new favorite shoe instead of hiking boots or anything else.,5, Black,13.0,11.0,1,2016

Emeli Dennin,Comfy,  Shopping for shoes can be hard because I fit anywhere between 9/10. I bought the nines and I‚Äôm happy I did.

W. D.,Go for a Loose Fit,"  Liked the free return-The first pair was a size too small, the Clogs I ordered as a replacement fit perfectly. A comfortable size for me turned out to be 1/2 size larger than the fit I like for a shoe. When first wearing I thought the loose fit would be a problem with the Clogs slipping off as the back strap is not adjustable but due to good design by Crocs the Clogs are completely secure and do not slip off. My advice is to go for the loose fit as it makes for a very comfortable fit.wd",5, Black,13.0,11.0,0,2018
Kalie,Love my crocs,  I bought a pair for work and purposely needed up buying a size bigger so I could use the strap on the back.

I wear a Woman's 8.5 shoe but this size (Women's 8 M/Men's 6M) works for me. They are a bit large around the toe box but is doable. I do like the movable strap which a nice option.

It's roomy, but not to the point where my foot flops around feels insecure, and there's enough room to wear the clogs with socks on. I like that they're easy to slip on and off and have good traction on wet surfaces. So now I just have to see how they'll do over time. They're replacing a pair of sandals that I bought in Hawaii thirty years ago and are still wearable, but I like the fact that the Crocs have a little more toe protection.",5, Navy,10.0,8.0,0,2018

I love the colors, the comfort,  everything about crocs.  My next color are going to be grass green. Lol",5, Ice Blue,10.0,8.0,1,2019
Abby,Comfortable!,  I‚Äôm not gonna lie I used to make fun of these shoes all the time. Then I tried a pair on and omg so comfy! I purchased hot pink and they came exactly as that. I love to wear these anytime and anywhere. I have flat feet and they are super comfortable. I‚Äôm deff going to be buying more colors.,5, Electric Pink,9.0,7.0,0,2020
Mikayla,I love crocs!,  Does fit a little on the big side. They are quite wide and roomy but I believe that helps your feet breath as well as leaving plenty of room to wear socks if wanted to. They are very soft almost squishy material. But comfortable and durable material. I ordered a size 7 in women‚Äôs I only have about a half size of room left. I would order the size your normally are don‚Äôt size up or down.,5, White,7.0,5.0,0,2020
ChefShellie,You can‚Äôt really go wrong with Crocs!,"  Can you really go wrong with crocs?  Sure, they are ugly as dried mud, but oh are they sooo comfy!!  My podiatrist suggested them to wear instead of slippers and said they are one of the best things you can put on your feet. This is my 4th pair.  I do really love the dark gray, but I still won‚Äôt wear them in public, lol.",5, Slate Grey,10.0,8.0,0,2020
katy,Good after a size exchange,"  My kids love crocs. I don't know if this was a fluke or not but this pair ran small. This is a woman's 9 and it fits like a women's 8.  I previously purchased a women 8, and when I received it I held it up to my daughter's women's 7 and it was the exact same size.",4, White/Cantaloupe,9.0,7.0,0,2020
Amazon Customer,"Easy on, easy off","  Just what I was looking for, something easy to slip on when I walk the dog. When it's early in the morning or middle of the night and my canine wants to venture out, sometimes it's not easy to affix my shoes to my hooves when I'm half asleep. I can just slip these suckers on without even trying. They're ugly but in a charming way. They are moderately comfortable, though they do make my feet sweat. Not really a problem though since I plan on wearing them even when it's cold outside.",5, Navy,15.0,13.0,1,2017
Charlie Quinn,Finally broke down (literally) and bought a pair,"  I bought these while I was in the hospital recovering from an ATV accident. I was at the beach with my family and friends and had to be life flighted, in the process - my shoes were forgotten. At the hospital they kept giving me these nonslip socks to wear and I decided crocs would be easy to slip off and on in the hospital room as I did my PT and they are comfortable enough to use with a walker or in the shower. Amazon Prime had them here in 2 days, they were cheap, and they were exactly what I needed.I wear between an 8 and 8.5 in women's and these 8's fit perfectly.",5, Black,8.0,6.0,0,2017
Cedrie,Crocs for a win,"  I spend 40 hours a week on my feet on concrete floors. And I walk a lot. I have a very difficult time finding shoes that I don't ache to take off before a couple hours have past. I have wide feet, tall feet, and have a heel lift I wear in my left shoe (which creates its own shoe criteria). I need slip resistant ventilated shoes. These classic crocs fit the bill. I will always be wearing these with socks. They are wide enough for my feet, tall enough for my instep (even with the heel lift) and are quite comfortable to wear all shift. These are not fashion shoes and I don't expect them to be that, but for all the rest of the times, these will be the shoes I wear. My only caution would be that these shoes have little cushion. The rubber does have some give but it is not the same as a well padded shoe. For me this is acceptable because they don't hurt my feet to wear. Other's may find that to be a turn off.",4, Black,10.0,8.0,1,2015
Lisa Pilgrim,Finally a perfect work shoe!,  I have been on the hunt for comfortable work shoes for years and I can‚Äôt believe I never tried crocs. My feet and knees are finally happy. I work 40+ hours a week and I have finally found relief from my constant foot pain. And they are super cute. Can‚Äôt wait to order more!,5, Melon,8.0,6.0,0,2020
JeriMac,I've bought cheaper immitations - don't bother - they hurt my feet.  These Crocks are comfortable.,"  After owning one pair of Crocks which I loved, I tried to buy something cheaper just for gardening.  Actually I tried a couple of imitations and only ended up with painful feet.  Finally, I bought these and I'm back to walking in comfort again.  Crocks are worth it.",5, Cantaloupe,7.0,5.0,0,2020
tonya powell,You need at least one pair,"  Everyone should own at least one pair of crocs!!! They are comfortable and like walking on air. Working long shifts at an ER, my feet used to hurt wearing any shoes but wearing crocs my feet never hurt again. Now I wear them everywhere and got so many people wearing them. You won‚Äôt regret having a pair.",5, Cantaloupe,9.0,7.0,0,2020
Loreezy,Just Right!,"  These were a birthday gift (by request) and they were a hit!  She normally wears 8.5, so since they don't come in half sizes, I ordered a 9 - which was TOO big.  However, the return was easy, I quickly ordered a size 8 and it was perfect.  Plus the Ballerina Pink was a great color choice!",5, Ballerina Pink,8.0,6.0,0,2020
S W,"Comfy shoes, bit of a friction issue","  These things are super comfy and fit my feet perfectly, only issue is when worn without socks the rubbing between the clog and my foot creates hot spots. As i get used to them this goes away, but definitely worth thinking about if you are buying them and planning on a lot of walking right away.",5, Grass Green,12.0,10.0,0,2020
Jody Agins,Perfect,"  This was a requested gift for our granddaughter's 13th birthday!  She had to have white, which is a little more difficult to find during the ""Age of COVID"".  It is VERY important to measure the foot!  She usually wears a size 4, which was impossible to find, after her dad measured her foot, it said a size 6...which fit perfect!",5, White,6.0,4.0,0,2020
Burns Fam,Good quality but too small,  Great crocs quality but fits too small. This is the next size up from my son's current size and when they were delivered we held them side by side and they looked like the same size as the old ones although the size on the bottom said differently. Unfortunately we have to return and order 2sizes up this time and hopefully those will fit.,4, Black,7.0,5.0,0,2020
Chris G,Where have you been all my life!?,"  This was my first pair of crocs, after poo-pooing them for years.  Now I regret waiting so long!  These shoes are perfect for something quick to slip into to run errands, walk the dogs, or head to the park.  AMAZINGLY comfortable (think walking on clouds comfortable), durable, and light-weight.  My sandals, that I've lived in for years, are taking a back seat to my new croc beauties.",5, Chocolate,13.0,11.0,0,2019
Stephanie Vazquez,LOVE LOVE! Comfiest shoes for around the house and errands.,  Yay!! My summertime clogs came in! I've been using the winter Crocs and felt like they were too hot for the warmth that's going to come. I decided to switch it up a bit since I know my 9 WOMENS run big which is perfect for winter and fuzzy socks... but for summer I decided to size down for just the perfect fit! I'm an 8.5 and ordered an 8 WOMENS 6 MEN and don't regret it at all.,5, White,8.0,6.0,0,2020
SE Douvan,Especially great for swollen feet!,"  I'm having new problems that has caused my feet to swell.  These shoes are great due to the ample foot-bed, wide and very roomy.  I have bought 4 pairs for summer, one size bigger than usual.  They are esp. great (esp. during pandemic) because you can throw them into the washing machine.",5, Black,8.0,6.0,0,2020
Featnik,Black Crocs rule!,"  Let's face it. Crocs are ugly. Having said that, I bought these and wear them constantly - they are like walking barefoot with rubber bumpers. I had to re-learn my natural gait after hip replacement last year and Crocs were my go-to shoe during that time. I've recommended Crocs to friends having knee surgery for the same reason. These classic style black Crocs are the same size as purple classics I've had for years but these fit the way shoes should - I didn't realize how loose and big the older pair were. I believe they were manufactured in different countries which seems to make a difference in sizing. Go Crocs!",5, Black,8.0,6.0,0,2018
Sabine S. Holub,Great for watering the yard and backpacking!,  I am not a crocs on the street kind of gal but I needed a decent shoe for watering my flowers and weeding in the yard. I had bought the more expensive Birkenstock garden version but they were too stiff and uncomfortable. I knew from backpacking that crocs can be quite comfortable and a life saver when crossing creeks etc so I decided on these as my garden muck shoes! They work well but look goofy!,5, Navy,9.0,7.0,0,2019
Alexandria Tikalsky,Cute? No. Practical? Absolutely,  If you've never owned crocs before I really highly recommend them. Don't get me wrong I do not wear these to work or to social events. I don't buy them because they're cute. I buy them because they're practical. I can wear them in the river or when I'm gardening. They also are great to take hiking in case you don't want to jam your feet into your tennis shoes when you have to get up and out of your tent in the middle of the night. I imagine if I lived on a beach I'd wear them there too. They are super easy to clean and I honestly could wear them for days on end I think they're so comfortable.,5, Navy,9.0,7.0,1,2016
Gaby,best buy of my life. MUST HAVE!!,  wow. what can i say. it's been a few years since i got these crocs and they have been with me through thick and thin. crocs are a HUGE thing at my camp so it was imperative that i buy a pair. the only problem was what color to get and where to buy them from??? i found these on amazon and fell in love. the color is sososo pretty. i got so many complements. also if you are buying crocs you MUST buy JIBBITZ!!!!!!!!! really important. all of my croc holes currently have jibbitz in them and it makes them 100x cuter.,5, Ice Blue,8.0,6.0,0,2019
Myrtle P,Nice purple Crocs,  I'm so happy these are coming back in style. They're super comfortable and the bright colors are so much fun. I'm old enough  to be a grandmother and I like putting the little decorative Jibbitz in the holes.  I like having several pairs in different colors.  They're so comfy I don't care if people think they're ugly.,5, Neon Purple,9.0,7.0,0,2020
WV Radio Guy,Very good quality and price!,"  Great fit for my size 10 feet, and the best part is that these cost MUCH less than they do at the store. I've purchased cheap knockoffs that cost almost as much as these, and they werent half as good. I've worn these every day and the soles dont show any wear. More importantly, they are soft and comfortable, while the knockoffs are stiff and uncomfortable. Some people like to wear these barefoot or with socks, while I prefer to place ""Oder Eaters"" or some other foam in them.  Very good quality and price!",5, Black,12.0,10.0,0,2018
Sarah,Great as always!,"  Love my Crocs! I have always loved Crocs but haven't purchased them in the past with my shoe size being a true 7.5. I've always felt the 8 was too floppy/loose and 7 was snug and unable to use the strap if wanted/needed. But, I love the feel of wearing Crocs so I went ahead and bought the 7's. Yes they are snug, but they are so comfortable I don't mind! Plus I never wear them with the strap down anyway. Recommend!!",5, Slate Grey,7.0,5.0,0,2020
jenniloublue,Adequate replacement; okay arch support but not as flexible as I wanted.,"  This style was the closest I could find that resembled my crocs that finally wore holes through the bottom after 12 years. The arch support is okay; my older ones did have more arch support & fit me better. The older ones also had more flexibility because of the material they were made from. At the time there was only one kind of croc. Now there are so many styles,  so I may have to try other styles to find a completely satisfying replacement.",4, Slate Grey,11.0,9.0,0,2019
Elio Killen,Bought two pairs.,"  I bought two pairs of the same black crocs a day a couple days apart, and one pair is from the distribution chain in Mexico, which are a bit more tough and fit more true to a shoe size, and the other pair came from the distribution chain in China, which happened to be a bit softer and roomier pair. Both look pretty much the exact same, but there's slight differences based on which country you get yours from. Overall not a big deal, I love mine and prefer the ones from China honestly.",4, Black,9.0,7.0,0,2020
endlessknot,Once you wear Crocs you wont go back to other sandels.,"  I've been a Crocs fan forever. For sandals, they are the best.

We live in the valley in LA and they have shrunk when left out side in 90 plus Fahrenheit weather.",5, Khaki,9.0,7.0,0,2020
RobertsMom,Soo comfy especially w socks (in the privacy of your home),"  What can I say it‚Äôs a croc shoe. Fits and works as expected. It‚Äôs a replacement pair for a pair I had for 9 years that had finally worn down - I only use them in the backyardIf you are new to crocs; a nerdy piece of advice, if you wear them with socks you‚Äôll be sooo comfy like you‚Äôre wearing those adult onesies Amazon sells & any cool factor you had is gone but you won‚Äôt care because you are that comfy.",5, Garnet,8.0,6.0,0,2019
Stephanie Moreland,Cute and comfortable.,"  These are so cute! They are a bit snug on my feet, I wear a 8 but got a 9 just for width, however that didn‚Äôt make any difference for width. I can still wear with socks just but not thick socks. I suggest if you have a wide foot, go up a couple of sizes. Although I got a 9 they do not look like boats on my feet, which is positive. These came much quicker than expected and I will buy again.",5, Pink Lemonade,9.0,7.0,0,2020
JLB,So comfortable. Great for kayaking.,  I‚Äôm definitely a croc girl now! I bought a pair with the fur on the inside for winter while I was pregnant and they were soo comfy.

Amazon Customer,Affordable and Comfortable Slides in Style,  I own a black pair of crocs and I love them. I wear them when I am cleaning or doing something outside. I bought these white crocs for my daughter. She wears them for style and are easy to slide on and they fit comfortably. She wears them out a lot and around the house. Amazon has them for a great price. Much cheaper than buying them from the store directly. I bought my son a pair too!,5, White,6.0,4.0,0,2020
sam,really comfortable but can be sweaty and get pebbles,  i ordered several crocs (diff styles) - all clogs1- sizes are inconsistent from color to color and style to style2- left in the heat they will shrink and distort - that being said i needed to return 1 pair as the shoe was severely deformed- probably in the shipping3- therefore - make sure return shipping is free4- i do find most of the crog clogs to be INCREDIBLY comfortable5- they make your feet sweat  - the kinds without holes are worse - BUT they are easily washable6- front holes suck - pebbles often end up in the shoe7- once the sole wears down  they are INCREDIBLY slippery - anywhere a parking lot is painted is particularly dangerous8- i think they make the best slippers ever as the support is awesome9 - i love the fact they weigh almost nothing10 - i also got the styles without holes for colder and wetter weather11 - dont leave in the sun or heat they will shrink - some people use this to get a better fit,4, Black,9.0,7.0,1,2016
Kathi,Can't go wrong with Crocs!,"  I have been wearing this style of Crocs for many years.  Can't go wrong with them.  I have feet that are difficult to fit and need to wear something around the house that has a bit of arch support.  Crocs are the only footwear that fits the bill.  The toe box is ample, the width is just right, the length fits perfectly.  In ""normal"" shoes, I wear a size 10 XXW and these are perfect!",5, White,10.0,8.0,0,2019
Dede Stafford,Love These Crocs,"  These Crocs (as always) are incredibly comfy, durable, breathable, lightweight, and easy to clean.  Attractive??  Not so much.

Crocs are a staple in my closet.",5, Melon,10.0,8.0,0,2020

Chelsea Filer,Nurse that works long hours and loves these,"  As a nurse who works 16 hour shifts, I was surprised when a coworker recommended I try crocs.

M. Miles,Brother Likes Them,"  Bought for my brother who has back trouble. He, like me, has wide feet. He said they were big, then put socks on and said they were fine. He will probably need a couple of days to get used to have shoes that aren't squeezing his feet. He'll probably love them after a week of wearing.",5, Navy,15.0,13.0,0,2020
wally magoo,Nice for quick trips,"  These are great to slip into/out of for quick trips to the mailbox or garden. The fit is good except I can feel one of my toes hitting the clog on my left foot, so I probably wouldn't wear them for long walks. I think this is because of my feet and not the shoes. Overall, just what I wanted.",5, Lemon,8.0,6.0,0,2020
Patti Wismer,She loves their fit and how comfortable they are,"  My daughter suddenly has a Croc obsession.  She has about 7 pairs, all different colors.  She loves their fit and how comfortable they are.  She has been wearing them to school (high school) and seems to be starting a trend.  She also wears them to the softball field and in between games. (Camo is her field color)  She referred her friends to Amazon as the shipping is free AND they have a great variety AND they are cheaper than at the outlets.  I think I will even be getting a pair or 2 for Christmas...  :)  BUT WE CANNOT FIND PURPLE FOR A LOWER PRICE!  That is her high school color...  They aren't as cheap as the other colors for some reason.  :(But we still love Crocs!!",5, Navy,8.0,6.0,2,2015
John Tomlinson,CROCS are great shoes,"  I have been a CROC wearer for many years.  This was a replacement pair for some that were wearing out after 6+years.

Susan Iler,Crocs are so comfortable!,"  My husband, myself and kids all got Crocs for Christmas and they are awesome!

His was a little trickier but otherwise they were straight forward sizing.",4, Black,7.0,5.0,0,2020
Chrys Marie,Absolutely amazing,"  The best thing on this earth for anyone‚Äôs feet!! Bought a pair for myself and my boyfriend. He absolutely hate the style, and so do I. But I cannot deny how freaking comfortable they are!!! I have trouble finding good comfortable sneakers because I have semi wide feet. But these are absolutely amazing and comfy. Great for the entire family!! Also the material is so nice, it will not allow your foot to slide out of the shoes at all. And cleaning then is super easy. No complaints.",5, Black,13.0,6.0,0,2018
joanne walimaa,I'm sorry I waited so long!,"  I've been aware of these since they came on the market but have never been motivated to try a pair, what a mistake.They are the do-all shoe. They are shower shoes, gardening shoes, mow the lawn shoes, kick around the house shoes. If they get dirty just hose 'em off and you're good to go again. They have great grippers on the bottom and don't slip on a wet patio like flip-flops do. Why oh why did I wait so long, better late than never!",5, Chocolate,15.0,13.0,0,2020
Allison,Convienent shoes,"  The ideal user for this product is any person boy or girl who is looking for a comfortable, durable, and water resistant shoe. These shoes are perfect slide on shoes for any quick, pick up situation. Whether that be running errands, taking the dog out, or anything else. These shoes are made for all ages, come in a variety of colors and are made for both sexes.These shoes are very durable and water resistant. I bought a pair of white ones in august of 2017, and they still look brand new (and I wear them way too often.) They clean up very easily and are perfect if the ground outside is wet or muddy. They have holes along the side and on the top which allows your feet to breathe. An amazing quality about these shoes is that they are wide enough so you have enough space in the shoe to wear a sock!These shoes have many positive characteristics about them. I would say the most positive aspect of them is that they are very convenient, and can be worn in any situation. But other positive aspects of these shoes are that they are comfortable, breathable, easy to clean, water resistant, come in all colors, and the list is endless!Most people are hesitant in purchasing these shoes because of the way they look, but since 2016 crocs have become popular again. If a shoe like these are this comfy no one should care about what they look like! I have had a very positive experience with my crocs and I would recommend any to purchase these, because they are worth the money. I am all about convenience and these shoes are my go to whenever I‚Äôm about to run out and need to slide something on quick.These shoes are made for everyone and not only are they convenient for an adult to wear, they are perfect shoes for children to wear as well. They can get them dirty and run around outside and the can be cleaned off fast, while not being ruined. They also sell gibbets for these shoes, making them personable and a fun attraction for children.Overall I would give these shoes overall a very positive review because I have gotten a lot of use out of mine. They are worth every penny and a great investment. They last a long time and are great shoes to own.",5, White,7.0,5.0,0,2018
Ariel,Crocs are awesome!,"  I purchased a pair of these for my mother and mother-in-law. They both have never owned crocs before and ABSOLUTELY loved them!!

ealovitt,These crocs last forever,"  I already had a similar pair of Crocs when I ordered these.  I decided I wanted one pair for inside the house, and the other pair for outside.  Even though I normally wear a size 8.5, Crocs don't come in half-sizes, so I ordered an 8, and they fit very well.",5, Pool,8.0,6.0,0,2020
L.,Most comfortable shoe,  I finally convinced myself to get these and it was the best decision. They are so comfortable. I initially got a size 11 but had to return them to get a 12 due to needing a wider width. These are the only size 12 shoes I own so the size may run a bit smaller in width.,5, Chocolate,14.0,12.0,0,2020
Toospendie,The best house shoes ever made,"  This is my third pair of Crocs clogs. I personally think they're ugly and I can't figure out how they ever became fashionable but so it goes. The thing is, I have fallen arches (pes planus) and I my feet kill (I used the word ""kill"" to describe pain) me sometimes! These are far and away the most comfortable things I can put on my feet. They're light as air and they kind of form-fit to my arches. It's like getting a mini-massage just by walking around. I wear them whenever I'm lounging around the house or doing chores but I don't wear them outside at all. Something else to note: They don't stink. At least not for a long time. I think that's pretty remarkable. When they do start to smell, I couldn't really figure out an effective way to clean them so I just threw them away and bought new ones (they also lose their form a little after a year or so). I figure I can afford a pair every year or so so that I can have happier feet.",4, Khaki,13.0,11.0,0,2013
GK,New Convert to Crocs <3,"  I have resisted these shoes for years! Finally tired of ruining my regular shoes by wearing them in the garden or accidentally stepping in something I should have picked up earlier, I have finally found a shoe that I can wear and wash--and is TRULY COMFORTABLE AND LIGHT. You don't really think about how light shoes are until you put Crocs on. In fact, I liked them so much I bought a second pair to wear out and about. I never thought it would happen but I am truly a Crocs lover now!To be fair, I don't love the way they look, and my feet sometimes get cold so I bought socks. (Yes, I went there!) But I have gotten to a point in my life that function beats form and I am the happier for it.",5, Pepper,10.0,8.0,1,2015
Annonymous,Good buy!,"  My husband and I were apprehensive to purchase these crocs initially but after reading the reviews, we hesitantly purchased them and I am glad we did.  It has been 6 months now since we've purchased them and they are still holding up well. They are great quality and definitely originals. They also fit true to size and look exactly as seen in the photo.NB. My husband wears size nine in all regular shoes, so we ordered size 9 & it fit well.",5, Navy,11.0,9.0,0,2019

MGN83,Comfortable.  Keeps feet cool and dry.,"  So comfy.  I bought these to use for indoors.  My usual house slippers are way too hot for this California weather.  These crocs keep my feet cool and dry.  I normally wear a size 7.5 and I bought the size 8.  It‚Äôs perfect, not too loose.  Bought another pair to use for outdoors.",5, White,8.0,6.0,0,2020
Abigail,Admirably covers my husband's big feet,"  Crocs are ugly. We all know it. Nobody buys crocs to be a fashion icon (I hope). This aside, they're a good utilitarian shoe. My husband has to wear close-toed shoes to his work, and tennis shoes were killing his feet (they're big and not made to fit inside confining shoes ha).He has to wear socks with them (really highlighting his stellar sense of fashion) because apparently the holes on top pull the hair out of the top of his feet. Go figure. However other than that, he says they're comfortable and provide good support.I was also pleased that these shoes come in boat size, as not all brands carry for large-footed people.",4, Black,17.0,15.0,0,2016
Richard,"Looks Like Yuck,  Feels Great","  I usually wear a size 10D, and ordered these in size 10D.  If I wore these with socks, they'd be a perfect fit.  In bare feet, they're just a little loose (surprise surprise).  I wish they'd been available in my size in another color.  My only option was Khaki, which looks like rice-fed doggy poop.  But I don't wear 'em to look at them.  I wear them because they feel great.  And for the price (under $20, delivered by amazon Prime, go amazon!) I can't complain.  They're great clomp around clogs, keep your feet warm wet or dry, kick out irritants through the many open holes, and are very comfortable on my feet.  I have yet to use the heel strap or take them for a significant walk, but that's not why I bought them.  I wanted super easy on and off, comfortable enough to run errands in, and secure enough on my feet that I didn't have to think about where I put my feet when walking in them.  They fit the bill quite nicely, thank you very much.",5, Khaki,12.0,10.0,0,2013
Trish Brown,As always crocs are way too expensive!,  Well all crocs are oversized so I can‚Äôt even wear socks with these. The last pair of crocs I had about 12 years. I didn‚Äôt think I‚Äôd like the straps but you can fold them up on top of the shoe if you want to. I do use the straps when I‚Äôm driving. As always crocs are way too expensive!,5, Garnet,6.0,4.0,0,2020
Jordan,I love my crocs!!,"  I absolutely love my crocs! They are the easiest shoes to slide in and out of, and you can get them FILTHY. All you need to do is take a wet rag and wipe them off, or blast them with the hose. Then BOOM, clean. I wear these season round, with winter-y socks, of course. I have had the crocs professional bistro clogs for work (I work in foodservice) for awhile now, which led me to just buy regular crocs because they were just soo comfy. Highly recommend for people looking for easy-on, easy-off shoes that are very comfy.",5, White,9.0,7.0,0,2020

My feet used to hurt by the end of the day when I was wearing athletic shoes, but not with Crocs on. My feet stay comfortable all day.  I wear Crocs year round, even in the snow and rain.",5, Black,8.0,6.0,0,2020
Amazon Customer,Saves me from going in store AMAZING,"  Love my crocs but I didn't want the embarrassment of buying them in store, so amazon saved me from that. I'm a nurse in a nursing home type setting in Florida where it is hot. We walk outside a lot from building to building. So, airy crocs have saved me from sweaty tennis shoes on hot days.They fit just like in store would",5, Slate Grey,9.0,7.0,1,2019
Joey,FIFTH PAIR...,"  ... and counting.  Years ago, when I got my first pair of Crocs, I was dubious and totally unconvinced they'd live up to expectations.  Boy, was I mistaken!  Today, I have a pair of originals for warm-weather outdoor use, and another no-holes, fuzzy-lined pair for cold-weather outdoor use.  These are replacements for a worn-out indoor-only pair.  Crocs have essentially become my go-to house slipper and, used with a pair of plush socks, provide daylong comfort.  The arch support is superb and when I'm at the workbench, standing on a bare, concrete floor, my feet are happy!Enough gushing.  If you've worn them, you know exactly what I'm talking about!",5, Black,10.0,8.0,1,2015
V. Hernandez,Not perfect but close,"  I love the soft pink color. I wear an 8 and without the strap, these fit great. With the strap my left foot which is slightly larger than the right feels like it reaches to the top. I know a 9 would be too big. I'm keeping them anyway, hoping they will loosen a little.",4, Ballerina Pink,8.0,6.0,0,2020
Amazon Customer,FIRST TIME CROC BUYER,  Very comfortable! I have concrete tile floors so it helps my back. Bought a less expensive pair to see if I like them and if the size was right. Since they are Unisex shoes check the size chart. For example a Men's size 10 is a Woman's size 12. I wear a size 10 in a sneaker so a size 10 in a Croc was plenty big enough as they fit slightly larger. I wear them as a clog with the strap folded to the front. Great for a slip-on to run to the mailbox. I will get another pair.,5, Khaki,12.0,10.0,0,2019
Reyna G.,Better than In-site purchase !,"  These CROCS are my first Crocs and was kinda iffy about them at first . But now , I am obsessed with them ! Super light , comfortable and perfect for lounging around during this quarantine . This is the mint color and the color is bright and clean - just as i expected . I was going to purchase these on the Crocs site but it was more convenient to purchase through Amazon since it was more economic and with Prime arrived in less than a week . The fit was perfect for me - all I had to do was follow the size guide ! Recommend 10/10 !",5, Neo Mint,10.0,8.0,0,2020
Paul T.,Bought three pairs now,  I always made fun of people that wore crocs until I tried some. I can‚Äôt believe how comfortable they are. Especially for me I have to buy special shoes or inserts with arch support but these crocs are very comfortable as it is. And as promised they‚Äôre very good around the water.,5, Cantaloupe,12.0,10.0,0,2020
Carolyn,Comfortable to wear all day,"  Comfortable to wear all day.. We have several pairs in our family!  Some seem to run a little large...but not so much to pose a problem.  My hubby has narrower feet, so a little wide, but not sloppy feeling.  I have wide feet and mine always fit fine.  Slight arch support, probably enough for most people... I have plantar fasciitis - so no, not enough arch support for me, I wear an arch pad in all my softer shoes...  Wear in yard, on dock, around town etc...  Do watch..as heel tread wears off, can be a bit slick when walking on wet wood or metal docks...(time to buy new ones, as with most shoes/sneakers).",4, Citrus,11.0,9.0,1,2016
Marilyn,Extremely comfortable and a good fit.,"  I love these shoes. I work 12 hour night shifts at an assisted living facility, so I'm on my feet a lot. I've bought expensive shoes in the past which were not as comfy as these. And best of all, my feet no longer sweat. In other shoes my feet would sweat which would make them cold (not good in Wisconsin winters). Not so with these. Definitely will order more.Size fit perfectly. I wear an 8 1/2-9 wide and the women's nine was just right.",5, Navy,9.0,7.0,0,2019
Maria,I LOVE THEM,  so it was my first time ordering crocs and I am firmly a size 6.5 but they don‚Äôt come in half sizes. so i decided to go half a size up just in case and the size 7 fit perfectly!!!! the color is even prettier in person and they are so comfy! i will definitely be ordering more in the future,5, Ice Blue,7.0,5.0,0,2020
Steven Turner,Perfect lawn and garden footwear,"  In south GA, winter lawns can get soggy. These plastic shoes allow for outdoor time keeping my feet dry from wet grass and aired out via breeze holes. Very sturdy and durable, i have even walked the dogs with them and they are comfortable after a mile walk. We have a section of the yard that floods, requiring me to set up a pump system to drain water. These shoes stay on my feet as i wade the waters to place the pump in the center. They are easy to walk in thru the water.",5, Chambray Blue,7.0,5.0,0,2019
Amazon Customer,Comfy Crocs,"  I bought these for my daughter and she loved them, and alot cheaper than buying them through the Crocs website.  They were so comfortable I bought myself a pair.

Solerider,Great for 'round the house....,"  I've never tried Crocs until last week. Always wore thong sandals out around the house, when I was too lazy to put on real shoes/sandals. These are easy to slide into...are pretty darn comfortable...fit is good! I wear an 11EE shoe, with a high instep. My foot actually measures 10.5, but 11 fits better. I would say this fits true to size (unisex mens 11). I probably have 1/2"" of space at the heel....which is fine. Plenty of room in the shoe. Came in a Croc bag with their tags on the shoe....so they seem to be authentic. I would recommend!",5, Khaki,13.0,11.0,1,2016
Beantown,My first Crocs.....and they are sweeeeeeeet!,  I bought these for camping.....but I haven't taken them off (other than to sleep and shower) for days. These really are comfortable.

I think I want every color at this point.",5, Black,11.0,9.0,0,2020

It didn‚Äôt let me select my size so I was a little worried that my size wouldn‚Äôt come but it did! So I‚Äôm content with both my sets of crocs. If you‚Äôre worried about this, search your size specifically and more often than not you‚Äôll get your size without having to pay full price. I got these for $29",5, White,8.0,6.0,0,2020
Mats,"Great with socks, blisters without them.  Super comfortable.","  I've had to recant all the insults I've leveled at friends for wearing crocs in public...  They are super comfortable.The fit is as expected and they've held up well so far.  I can't wear them without socks without getting blisters or severe rubbing after an hour or so, but with socks they are as comfortable as they get.  I will probably get some of their slippers/moccasins as I think they'll be a very comfortable if they're anything like these.All in all, These are great for working on my garage and around the house.  They are easy to clean and super comfortable when worn with socks.",5, Chocolate,11.0,9.0,1,2016
JohnNYC,So Far So Good,"  So far, it's easy to wear 'n comfortable, however I do hope this will last longer for the price I paid versus a similar pair I bought from a Daiso store, made of cheap rubber material 'n easily worn out although things are ""Made in China"" now a days, still any product manufacturer is responsible in using ""quality"", ""decent"" 'n ""durable"" materials as well as making thoughtful, ""experimented"", sound design for a product to withstand daily wear with occasional treading on treacherous, rough ground to occasional speedy pace on a walk.",4, Black,10.0,8.0,1,2017

G. S. K.,Perfect for the new COVID life,  I should have bought a pair of Crocks sooner. Wearing slippers around the house all day long made my feet hot and damp.

Lee,Hesitant? I was...,"  So I was the guy saying ""No! Never doing Crocks!"" I will tell you man I love those things! They are so comfortable and great for camping and trips. Wear them with socks when its cold and not when its hot. Water? Dew on the ground? NO Problem... Don't get me wrong, Flip-Flops have a huge place in my heart but I just took my crocks on a 7700 mile motorcycle camping trip and I was so happy I had them. They were a great component to what I needed to be comfortable. Just give them a try but just don't start wearing them to work. Just not acceptable..",5, Pepper,13.0,11.0,0,2018

Bmcgnh,Great support and fit.,  This shoes are far from fashionable and I *never* wear mine outside the house but they are great comfortable footwear. They were recommended to me by my orthopedic surgeon when I was struggling with plantar fasciitis that was aggravated by the hardwood floors in our apartment. He recommended a pair of Crocs to wear as house slippers since they have great arch support.There fit somewhat sloppy though--that's just the way they are. Don't get them too tight. When in doubt I'd suggest you order the larger size.Easy to slip into and out of and if I spill something on the floor or on the shoes I just wash them off in the sink.,5, Navy,12.0,10.0,1,2015
Denise P,They just work!,  Love ‚Äòem or hate ‚Äòem - Crocs are Crocs. These fit the same as the ones I‚Äôve had for about 10 years - except the old ones are worn through the sole. They are the best shoes to kick on when you‚Äôve got to run outside in a hurry to chase off a marauding deer or curious bobcat looking for a tasty chicken dinner. And they‚Äôre actually quite comfortable as well.,5, Neon Purple,8.0,6.0,0,2020
Brianna,Best shoes ever.,"  I have been on the fence about owning Crocs for a long time. I wasted that time. Buy these shoes.

They can also be worn in ""relaxed mode"" with the thingy on top of your foot for lazy Sundays and doing chores.",5, Neo Mint,9.0,7.0,0,2020
Vinh ,Great if you have sweaty feet.,"  I have sweaty feet so rubber sandals are literally the only type of sandals I can wear. Any other sandals I wear I have to wash otherwise it‚Äôll stink. I don‚Äôt have to wash these rubber sandals because they don‚Äôt stink and don‚Äôt absorb my sweat. These are well made and are really durable, but I don‚Äôt recommend running in them.

Ryan,Once You Croc You Just Won't Stop,  Do you want your little piggies to be protected from the harsh environment? Do you care about comfort over style? Do you want house shoes that you can wear around your dogs and out in the yard without them falling apart? Do you want to be able to just hose a pair of shoes off after they get dirty?

He outgrown several pairs of crocs over the years, and always like them.However, if you wanted to wear the strap behind your heel as pictured, buy a size up - the strap is shorter then needed, I wear Woman's size 9 so should fit in this shoes well, but with the strap down, my toes painfully push into the front of the shoe, and I cannot wear them. The problem is consistent - I have several years old pair of the same crocs in another color, and it is the same - fine with the strap up, but I cannot wear it with strap down.The shoes are very lightweight.",4, Black,9.0,7.0,1,2014

Music Lover2,Seem to work,"  I never bought Crocs before. These seem to work OK, so far. My only criticism is I wish they would come in half sizes. I originally bought size 11 which was too tight. I then bought size 12 which was a little too loose but more comfortable than the 11's. An 11 1/2 would probably be just right but that does not seem to be an option.",4, Black,14.0,12.0,0,2020
Boogily Woogily,Overall comfortable but could be better for long walks,  For the most part the Crocs are very comfortable and durable.

Not sure if that‚Äôs how crocs are supposed to be made but please AMAZON, check on the shoes carefully! And to answer why I didn‚Äôt return it was because I wore it the first day it was delivered to me and didn‚Äôt really paid much attention to it till the next day and it was kinda dirty already.

These crocs are so durable.  If I had a pair of regular flip flops, I would be on at least my 5th or 6th pair. This crocs have paid for themselves many times over.  I've worn them walking over rocks, stones, in showers, in the house, to the store, camping EVERYTHING.  I loved these things so much I bought a pair for my husband in the REALTREE camouflage and he now likes his.

I have some issues with foot pain, and my Crocs are the only shoe I have found that completely alleviate the pain. I have tried quite a few of the styles over the years, but this was the first time I have tried the clogs.

These shoes are very comfortable and I am very pleased.  I had a hard time finding Crocs in my size.  They aren't sold in the regular shoe stores and many online shoe stores have a very limited selection of 15 D shoes, as well.  Now if they will just be strong and hold up for a while.

LynnB,Crocs naysayers are so silly.  Crocs are awesome.,"  You don't wear Crocs for a fashion statement.  Well, maybe in some places, but not most places.  They're the flip-flops of the regular shoe community.  So easy to slip on.  So easy to wash off.  When my kids were little, they were ""big kid"" shoes they could put on themselves.  Now all of my big kids have a pair right outside the backdoor.  Slip them on to do everything year round (we live in Arizona.)  So far nobody has ever accidentally stepped in dog poo, but it could happen and if it did - easily washable.  They wore these shoes at at sleepaway camp for everything from showers to fishing to hiking.  They're durable.

Michael G.,Crocs are what they are,"  What are the holes in Crocs for? They are there to let your dignity out.  Jokes aside, these are surprisingly warm and comfortable.

Dave Musil,Best comfortable fitting shoe,"  I love these and wear them a lot. They have the typical Croc roomy fit which feels almost like you're barefoot.  You think that they would come off your foot when you walk but they don't.  They feel sort of gel-like on your feet with their cushiony rubber. I really like the option of using the heel strap or flipping it up so you can slip in and out of them easily, like slippers.  You get used to their quirky appearance, if not, get one of the more traditional looking models. I have three different styles which I wear exclusively as casual shoes.",5, Chocolate,14.0,12.0,1,2016

They're so cheap. And so squishy comfortable.The fit is spot on for me. I wear size nine in most shoes and the Croc 9 is perfect in length.

In the last year or two I've had problems with the new sizing for Crocs (purchased directly) and have had to return or giveaway or not wear four pairs. So I took a chance on ordering  this pair  and I was thrilled that they fit and they look really cute. I normally wear a size woman's nine which is what I ordered.  I am so pleased that I am going to order another pair just like them so I expect to be set for a number of years! One additional note, I have diabetic nerve damage and Crocs are the most comfortable shoes for my feet, in addition they keep my feet protected and provide additional stability for walking.

I stand on my feet for long hours as well so even wider toebox shoes chafe my toe and cause a lot of pain. To make it easy on myself I just stuck with one pair of walking shoes and never tried another one. Through the recommendation of a friend who has multiple foot issues I decided to give crocs a try.

Regular shoes hurt because of where they hit in the back of my ankle so I ordered some to give them a try. I ordered a size 8 and they fit well.  Arch support is there and they are open in the back so I actually walk more comfortably with them on.  I have also discovered that they are very comfortable on wood floors.  I have only worn them inside partly because because it's winter but really because they are kind of ugly. Think I'll keep them as ""inside shoes"".",5, Khaki,8.0,6.0,0,2019

Boomer,Wish they made half sizes,  I‚Äôm a consistent 9.5 in women‚Äôs. The 10s were enormous on me. So I went with 9. They are clearly too small. I got to wear in a rocky lake so I would rather not have them big and risk falling off. Disappointed in the sizing,4, Neon Purple,9.0,7.0,0,2020
B. Stirling,Khaki fits perfectly and Navy is enormous,  These are great and so comfortable.  I wear them to walk the dog through the wet grass and I don't slip and my feet stay dry.  I purchased the khaki and they fit perfectly (I wear a 7.5 or 8 shoe and bought the crocs in an 8).I purchased the same crocs in a size 8 in navy and they are enormous.  Can't imagine why there is such a difference between the two colors.  The navy will be returned.,5, Khaki,8.0,6.0,1,2017
Kasandra R.,My fianc√© finally gave into these and he's loves them,  Title says it all. He got the perfect size. Hes a size 9.5 and so he got a 9 in men. He loves them so much. He has really bad and plantar fasciitis and he says they feel incredible. His feet sweat a lot too but with these he said he barely cracked a sweat. Awesome shoes! I love them and he does too. #CrocGang,5, Black,11.0,9.0,0,2020
Sp,Why did I ever stop wearing Crocs?,"  I bought these for yard work, wearing around the house. My goodness, I have missed Crocs so much. I haven't had a pair in maybe 10 years, but I won't be without a pair again. I bought my regular size that I would normally wear.",5, Navy,8.0,6.0,0,2020

M. Rodriguez,Great shoes but not left/right consistent,"  The curve of the Croc at the instep strap connection was narrower than the right Croc, which results in slight rubbing against my left foot where there's clearance on the right foot. Not a huge deal since I am using these as house shoes and mostly with socks. I would have returned them if I were using as outdoor errand shoes.",4, Neon Purple,11.0,9.0,0,2020

Melinda in Texas,I love my Crocs !!!,"  I knew what size to order because I bought a pair locally, so the ones from amazon fit perfectly. My old ones looked too shabby to wear away from home. I wish you had BEIGE/TAN in my size...UPDATE APRIL 13, 2014:  I just read comments about ""made in Mexico"" and ""made in China"" ... interesting. My regular shoe size is 10.5, but the Crocs I bought recently and fit me perfectly are 'women's size 9'.  I just looked at the local-store-Croc and the amazon-crocs -- both were made in Mexico -- I guess 'that's a good thing.'

They‚Äôre flexible enough that that could have worked.",5, Navy,13.0,11.0,0,2020
J. Ramsey,Best thing since sliced bread!,"  I love my crocs! I wear them everywhere on dry days and even in the shower. I bought one pair in yellow and they were so comfortable I bought another in brown to wear out. The brown ones were different sizing than the yellow ones since the yellow beach ones were size 8-9 and the brown ones size Women's 8M. Both fit fine but the brown ones fit best with thin socks if I wear socks.I have diabetes and liver cirrhosis, both of which cause problems with legs and feet, so I need shoes that are very comfortable and not too tight. Crocs really are perfect. I thought the little bumps in the bottom inside would bother me in bare feet but they don't. They are roomy enough that if my feet swell a bit they still fit. They sort of stick to the soles of my feet (even with socks) so there's no rubbing against my sensitive skin.They are also great in the shower. I don't have to worry about slipping, especially when I use hair conditioner or body wash that is slippery, and I can wash my crocs at the same time I wash me. Fantastic!",5, Chocolate,8.0,6.0,0,2010
Danny F.,All-Terrain Slippers,"  I originally bought these so that I didn't have to put on socks and shoes just to check the mail (rocky driveway). I had no idea that I would love them as much as I do.Pros:- incredibly comfortable, I could wear them all day- my feet are wide, and they still fit perfectly- there is almost nothing you can do to mess them up, just wash the rubberCons:- when using the heel strap, it is very difficult for me to remove the shoes. I know that this is a feature, as that is the literal purpose of the strap, but sometimes it feels like a bug.These are the most versatile slip-on shoes I've ever owned.",5, Navy,12.0,10.0,1,2016

Great for schlupping around the house, etc., w/o having to don socks & shoes. I've never liked clogs before because they don't stay on my feet well, the back straps on these keep them well in place. Very comfortable to walk in, I regret it's taken me so long to discover this inexpensive, durable, comfortable footwear.

Paperden,For Ease & Comfort,"  It's about the ease of donning & doffing and general comfort. It's not about any aesthetic appeal, which it is perhaps not particularly high on. I found my first pair (of the original Crocs--new in box) while dumpster diving several years ago. I brought them home to show my wife just how absurd a pair of shoes can look. For a lark, I tried them on and--what do you know? Those goofy-looking shoes were extremely comfortable! I have worn them near daily ever since. Interestingly, after they started getting popular and appearing on lots of other people's feet, they stopped looking quite so goofy.As much as I like them, they are problematic for some occasions. Little rocks and dirt sometimes get in through the holes; when the soles get worn smooth from use they are extremely slippery on wet sidewalks; goathead stickers and glass can easily pierce through the soft sole and into your previously happy foot; Bare feet can sweat in the summer and slide around a bit; I wear them so much that I get tan spots through the holes, leaving my feet polka-dotted when I remove my shoes.Overall though, for the reasons of ease and comfort, I love 'em.",5, Black,13.0,11.0,1,2013
Lolita,These are so comfortable. I said that they do not have good ...,"  These are so comfortable.  I said that they do not have good arch support, but I have an extremely high arch and I don't feel it if it's there.  The shoes are contured and someone with a lesser arch may feel the support.  I can wear them all day w/ or w/out socks.  They are also extremely light-weight and that is a bonus!  I have now purchased a pair for my husband which he loves and wears all day too.  I have also purchased two more as gifts... want to share the comfort!  I definitely recommend and they do not run in 1/2 sized... I am at least an 8.5 and usually a 9 and the 8 fits me perfectly.  Hope this helps.",5, Chocolate,7.0,5.0,1,2015

D. Campbell,So comfortable!,"  Probably my fault, as my other pair fits perfectly, as I think that one is more like size 8.5 mens. I ordered the new ones in size 9, not remembering that I don't wear socks with Crocs, so the 8.5 would have been perfect. Next time I order them I will remember this!

Cheyenne,So comfy!,"  I love these shoes! I haven't worn them for a long period of time yet but they are comfortable. I am normally about a size 5.5 in women's but it didn't come in that size. After reading reviews that said they ran small, I gave the size 6 a try. They would probably be too small if I was actually a 6 but I was hoping they would run small. So far I love them.

Charlie,He's a good man and helped me during a time of distress ...,"  These shoes are made from some strange space age material unknown to mankind before this.  Despite hiking miles upon miles through the Himalayan mountains of Afghanistan for years on end, there is so far no signs of wear.  The tactical nature of the color scheme of this pair in particular will without a doubt protect my feet from being discovered by ISIS-K or the Taliban during my trek through the Afghan arid mountains and beyond.

Issy,Easy to clean shoes,  I bought these for my husband to use while moving irrigation pipes in tall grass fields.  The seeds don't stick to them like they did to his regular shoes.  They can be washed off easily.  The reason for one less star is that he wears a 9 1/2 shoe and these don't come in half sizes so I ordered a size 10 and they are a little large.  But they still work well and he hasn't had a problem with them falling off.  It would be great if Crocs would make half sizes for all.,4, Chocolate,12.0,10.0,0,2018
Jlowe,Pepper Unisex Crocs,"  I have ordered the Unisex Crocs from Amazon before and this Pepper red one looks just like the tan pair that I have and both were made in Mexico. But this pair is slightly smaller and the arch support does not appear to be the same as in my older pair.  I love the color as it was exactly what I was looking for, but I do think the size it a bit smaller that my old ones.

Of course I am wearing them practically all the time during the day, mostly indoors.Good price for Prime Member. Ordered navy too. Color doesn't matter as much to me, as how my feet feel at the end of the day.However, I do have a pair that is higher end and I use sometimes when going out.

This was not noticed at the store, but she gave them a good workout on carpeting (to protect the shoes in case she did have to return them) at home and found them to be uncomfortable. She gave the Crocs the same workout and was delighted by the fit and comfort. And as a bonus her favorite color is blue. And the knockoffs only came in black.

Amazon Customer,great shoes!,  If you don't care about what people think about your fashion sense these are the most comfortable shoes to buy ever. plus when they get dirty you can wear them in the shower or wash them in the sink. as you wear them the rubber will wear down and mold to the shape of your foot which only makes them even more comfortable. a pair will provide about 2-3 years of frequent use before the rubber becomes too thin and you step on a thorn that gets stuck in your foot for about a week.,4, Black,13.0,6.0,0,2018

So I ordered an 8 even though I wear an 8.5. This shoe fit my wide feet perfectly and was very comfortable. I love, love, love that I don't have to worry about getting dirt, water, soap, grass stains, etc. on these shoes because I can just wash them off with the hose. In the meantime, my athletic shoes stay in pristine condition. THEN, I started wearing the Crocs around the house while cleaning and running up and down the stairs doing laundry.

Lake water just does something to sandels and flip flops - they would stink so bad I could smell them from across the room.  Not his Crocs though!

SuzieMom,Slightly smaller croc classics,"  If you have classic crocs that you bought 5 years ago you'll find these running smaller than those did. That is, big for shoes, small for crocs. They are a little shorter, a little narrower and especially not as high in the toe box (i.e. lower profile). I wear 8 1/2 wide in standard women's shoes, and 8W, 6M in crocs was always perfect for me before. Now I think I would order a size up next time, even on what Croc bills as a ""roomy"" fit. Apart from fit they are the crocs we know and love (or hate as the case seems to be), nice bouncy feel, easy to clean, durable and perfect for everything but ballroom dancing.",5, Black,8.0,6.0,1,2015

Only problems experienced were losing the plastic ""rivet"" the backstrap pivots on and eventually the bottoms become slick and provide no stopping on slick surfaces. Fun story: took the Crocs to a sandal maker inside the Old City of Jerusalem. He studied the broken Croc, surveyed his available repair materials then using a metal rivet provided the needed repair.  He guaranteed another 1,000 miles.  Almost got it,too!Shalomrhp",4, Black,16.0,14.0,0,2018

Kindle Customer,Very comfortable... one size smaller next time.,"  I really didn't think I'd ever own a pair of Crocs let alone write a positive review about them! I bought a pair at my wife's urging because I have some foot problems...achy feet, plantar fasciitis, etc. The Crocs are incredibly comfortable to wear and bring immediate comfort and relief when I wear them. I have them next to my bed and slip them on first thing in the morning. I normally wear a size 13...when I get another pair I will be getting them in a size 12. The 13's are a little long and wide...not a problem, but I think I'll go one size smaller next time (and there WILL be a next time!)",5, Navy,15.0,13.0,3,2016

Snapper,Perfect house shoes,"  The color (khaki) is not great, but that was what was available when I ordered. These are for in the house, so who cares? These are replacements for some Crocs I have had over five years. Hard to tell when they wear out, but these new ones support my feet much better. On the arch support question - better than bedroom slippers, less than good athletic shoes. NOTE: Occasionally I will see an adult were Crocs in public - please don't!

mind dancer,The shoes are fine and I should be able to wear them for ...,"  I was used to purchasing Crocs in the ""from-to"" size range ( 9-10, etc.) so the size setup on these was a bit strange for me. The shoes are fine and I should be able to wear them for quite some time with no problem, but they are a wee bit narrower than my other crocs and since my feet tend to swell a bit in hot weather the narrower width might be a problem. Don't know yet. Otherwise the shoes are great--lovely color (Khaki) is a perfect neutral.",4, Khaki,11.0,9.0,1,2016

Jennifer L Eliassen,Great shoe for the beach...,"  I have to admit I really find the classic Croc unattractive, but incredibly practical under the right circumstances.  I dislike it for an everyday, all day shoe, but great for the beach or gardening.  Of course, my kids love them.  I have slipped on my son's from time to time (we wear the same size) and they are comfortable to walk in, but slippery if the inside gets wet.  The back strap doesn't really hold the heel the way I think a back strap should.Turns out my son wanted a bright color and was not excited about the khaki color, but he wears a lot of khaki shorts and I think it looks great.  He's 9, so for him bright and bold would be better!  The price I got on Amazon was better than at my local Croc store.",4, Khaki,8.0,6.0,0,2014

milkmaid,but they're very comfortable and excellent to wear around the house,"  I can never say crocs are ""beautiful shoes"", but they're very comfortable and excellent to wear around the house. I buy a pair and wear them for many years until the bottoms are completely worn out. I've never had a complaint about my crocs. I do suffer from plantar fasciitis so I put inserts in them for additional arch support.

Kindle Customer,Fits small. Order a size up.,"  These have a  cushiony sole and are well made. I got them to wear while I work in the yard and they are perfect for this because I can just rinse them off with the hose when I'm done. I ordered the Women's size 9. I usually wear an 8.5 but I listened to the reviews that said they ran small and boy am I glad I did! My toes just touch the end of the shoe. I would say they are about a 1/2 size too small. If I had to wear them for long periods while standing, they would be uncomfortable pretty quickly. So keep that in mind, if you're going to wear them for 8 hours at work. Overall I'm very happy with them.",4, Navy,9.0,7.0,0,2017

I am actually not sure about the arch support, but I also can't claim there isn't any, but since there was no option to be non-committal, I opted for the yes.  I do have a brace to wear on that leg with sneakers, but it becomes uncomfortable after a few hours and the clogs are light weight enough for me to use as an alternative both for several hours but also as a quick way to slip on to go outside to get the mail etc as I am mostly barefooted while at home.",5, Chocolate,8.0,6.0,0,2015

Justin J,Great Christmas Present from Husband!,  My husband bought these for me after I have been stealing his to wear in our basement.  These are so comfortable to wear for hours every day and are even better on my feet that they are actually the right size!  Part of our basement is unfinished and where our washer/dryer is and also our woodstove so we head to the basement quite frequently every day.  It is great to have a pair of shoes that you can slip on pretty quickly and go.  My feet are ALWAYS sore at the end of the night as well and these seem to have good enough support that my feet aren't as bad by the time I go to bed.

Aggie11,Great for puppy potty runs in the backyard,"  When Crocs first were introduced back when I was a kid, my mom and I would constantly call these ""the ugliest garden shoes we'd ever seen."" However, fast forward to when we got our first puppy who has to make countless potty runs at all hours of the night, and these are the most appreciated shoes! They slip on and off without having to lift a finger, and they are incredibly light weight. They are the perfect shoe for roaming around the yard, where no one can see your silly ""garden shoes""!

Rosabel Tamez,I love these CROCS which I bought for myself!!!,"  This is a roomy, comfortable shoe that I'm proud of so I gave it a 5-star rating. It's also easy to slip them on and off. I liked the price and free shipping which allowed me to save without waiting too long for them to arrive. These CROCS were made in Mexico and are a good fit as I expected. I recommend these to anyone who likes comfort and good fit.  My granddaughter works in an electrical plant which requires her to wear these shoes, so I recommend them to anyone who is required to wear them for work also. BTW, I don't believe these shoes are good for working outdoors doing yardwork as the soles are not intended for that purpose.",5, Navy,8.0,6.0,0,2013

I've been unable to walk without assistance for a long time, and it occurred to me that I needed to replace them, but the pair I had was purple, and it matched a lot of things in my world, clothes, my car! So I just knew that I had to replace them. I couldn't even read the size on the bottom they were so worn.  I couldn't find them in the size I needed due to swelling in my feet so I had to order a larger size.  Luckily they were available in my second favorite color.  I'm walking so much better!

And, the back-strap actually keeps them on your feet far better than other sandals.  Even to the point of necessitating you to push down on it a little to get `em off.  They've been around for a few years but this is my first pair.  Love `em. :-) Mar`18",5, Khaki,14.0,12.0,0,2018

Amazon Customer,So far so good,"  This is my second pair of Crocs (the first ones wore out).  I wear these shoes on the weekends (around the house/yard and to the store).  The size was a little larger than expected, but not unreasonable.  I'm actually glad they are a little larger in hopes that the added size will help improve airflow.  I've owned this pair for about a month and they seem to be holding up ok.  I was much happier to pay the Amazon price as opposed to what the store was asking.  I just hope it's the same quality; only time will tell.",4, Khaki,13.0,11.0,0,2015

David M. Craine,I'm very pleased with these Crocs,"  I'm very pleased with these Crocs. Never had Crocs before, and I was hesitant about looking goofy, but these are the best knock-arounds I've had in years. I struggle finding slides that will stay on my feet, but these are great‚Äîthey have the strap thingy in the back that also rotates to the front if you don't need it. Even without the strap, these stay on my feet better than any other slides I've owned. And the support is terrific‚Äîthe first time I wore them I took a 2.5 mile walk and they were extremely comfortable. They run a little large. I usually wear a men's 10.5, but they don't have half sizes, so I got 10s. They fit great, and if anything might be a bit large. Inexpensive, durable, easy to clean, great for doing yard work, shopping, or whatever.",4, Khaki,12.0,10.0,0,2017
Victoria Shelton,Lived Up to the Hype.,"  Crocs really are the coolest. Not only was I able to score a pair for a mere $23.00, but they are true to size and are the best shoes for those of us who enjoy the ability of slipping shows on and off. Just be forewarned, when you first get them they will have a weird ‚Äúwet‚Äù feeling. It will go away really Quickly though, in about a day or less.

We recently hiked 32 miles in three days with backpacks on the AT (Appellation Trail) in the smokey mountains.  One of my friends wore Crocs the whole way.  I couldn't believe it.  I thought he was ""the man"".  Finally we traded, and I understood.  His sole was easily 3 times thicker than mine.

I normally wear a women's 9 - 9.5 & although instructions for sizing said to go a size down on half sizes, I decided to go up.  (Personal preference - I just prefer a roomier fit.)  Very comfortable and not too roomie.  So glad I decided to go up on sizing instead of down.I have owned a lot of the knock-off brands in the past and I can honestly say that comfort-wise, they do not hold a candle to real Crocs.

I've wondered about Crocs but have never tried them before. A friend mentioned she used them to garden in and I decided to order a pair. I'm very satisfied. They're comfortable, easy to slog on and off, and because of all the holes, my feet remain cool. The 9M is on the roomy side, but my feet are more wide than narrow. Still, they stay on my feet without use of the back strap. Good purchase!",5, Navy,9.0,7.0,0,2014

They weren't, they were too small.  Thankfully it was no problem to return them and order one size bigger.  I picked the tan/khaki color and haven't regretted it for a second.

Even though the Caymen is supposed to be a closer fit than the Beach, they still feel very loose, as if they're going to fall off, at first. But after getting used to them and forgetting I had them on, I realize that this contributes to the comfort. Unlike my usual sandals, these dry by simply wiping them off which is a huge benefit in wet environments.

madamwillyoutalk,You made me love you. I didn't want to do it. I REALLY didn't want to do it!,"  Okay, so, let me get this review started off by saying I hate the way the original crocs look. I know, I know, so do a lot of people, but I really hate the way they look. I have always had large feet for a woman (10/10.5), so I really don‚Äôt like shoes that emphasize the fact that I am walking around with feet that could double as water skis at a moment‚Äôs notice.  As many of you have observed, these shoes are not very good at minimizing the appearance of the size of feet they are on.Okay, so now that I have my fussing out of the way, I love my crocs. To the point where if my house was on fire and I could save one pair of shoes, I would save my crocs.I was first introduced to crocs when I was 20 after I developed an almost crippling case of plantar fasciitis due to working a retail job where I wore heels on hard tiled floor for 10+ hours, 5-6 days a week. I could barely walk without being in excruciating pain. Not fun. I went to see a podiatrist who didn‚Äôt do any of the useful things most would have done like offering the night splints or anything like that. He said that I could do a series of injections in my feet, which sounded oh-so appealing, or I could do some stretches, stay off my feet as much as possible, and try wearing crocs whenever I could. I took option b.  I started wearing my crocs from the moment that I got up, until I had to go to work, where I now had a doctor‚Äôs note saying that I had to have comfortable, flat shoes.  I didn‚Äôt wear the crocs to work, that would have been pushing it, but I did wear the most comfortable shoes I could without making my department manager‚Äôs eye twitch when she looked at them. Then, as soon as I got home, I would take them off, and put my crocs back on. The pain lessened almost immediately, and while it was a combination of keeping off my feet, the stretches, and the crocs, the shoes were definitely the most important factor. They helped so much that I wore them outside of the house while running errands. Within a month, the pain had gone from an all-day, all-consuming factor, to something bothered me for only one hour after waking. After two months, I didn‚Äôt even need to wear them anymore, so I stopped.Fast-forward five and a half years and I am pregnant with my first child and the crocs came out yet again. They were my best friends during the second and third trimester and I haven‚Äôt put them up since. For some reason, probably partially due to the way I sleep, which allows my muscles in my calves and ankles to tense up really well, I have had a mild problem ever since having my daughter. It isn‚Äôt debilitating like the first time, it only hurts for about 10 minutes when I first get up in the morning and I am stretching my muscles out, but I wear my crocs at all times when I am in the house.  My husband, whom I met after my first experience with crocs teased me about them quite a lot. He is European and thinks that crocs are some bizarre American fashion statement and had an excellent time laughing at them. But he also has a job where he is on his feet all day, and a month ago he started showing symptoms of plantar fasciitis. I gave him my crocs to wear around the house, remember, I have giant feet, and they went up a size due to my pregnancy to boot (11) , and he has wears a 10.5 in men‚Äôs shoes, so while mine were a little tight, they were comfortable enough. He stopped giving me any grief after he spent a few days clomping around the house in my bright purple crocs. After I peeled myself off the floor after a very satisfying guffaw I got him to admit that they were really helping and that he didn‚Äôt want to walk around without them anymore. Victory is mine! So, because I wanted me crocs back, guess what he got for Christmas? A lovely pair of plain, black crocs all his own.Now, I‚Äôm not a doctor or nurse of any kind, but I can tell that these have really helped my husband and I ease the pain from, and in my earlier case eliminate, a painful condition. Are they pretty? No. Have they worked for us? Yes.I have a pair of size Women's 11 crocs right now and they are perfect for walking around the house, but they are a bit loose, I wouldn't want to try to sprint in them. I have wide feet, and they are perfectly roomy, not tight at all.I bought my husband a Men's size 10, he usually wears a 10.5, and they are a little roomy for him as well, but not to the point where it is an issue. So, judging from my experience, these run a little large and wider than average.",5, Black,12.0,10.0,17,2016

I bought them as year round house shoes and I love them! They fit JUST RIGHT without the wrap down on the back with thicker socks. When the strap is down they slightly push my toes into the top.

Michael,Roomy but comfortable,"  As other purchasers have noted, the sizing of Croc brand clogs is off. I would guess that these and the pair of Croc Sport clogs are a full size larger than the number sizing would indicated. Because these are clingy to the foot, they don't shift around despite the sizing so we chose not to exchange for a smaller size. Previous non-Croc branded clogs we've owned shrank over time, especially when exposed to a lot of sun so it is possible that Croc brands do the same and account for the generous sizing. Overall, the build quality is quite good and these Crocs are comfortable.",4, Khaki,11.0,9.0,0,2013

kcamperz,Perfect!,"  What can I say, they are Crocs. They are comfortable. They are not the most stylish shoes but the fact that they can be worn everywhere in Orlando makes up for that. They are fine to get wet at the beach or pool, fine to get sand all over, fine to wear in the mud (as long as you don't mind your feet getting muddy too) because you just have to hose them off.

I know they're great for outdoor use also but I don't have a yard anymore so for me it's not necessary.,5, Pepper,7.0,5.0,0,2018
Santa Settles,The fit I remember.,"  Crocs are about the only shoes I wear due to my wide foot and particularly high arch. My last pair of crocs were a different style and they were considerably narrower. I was delighted that these were the comfortable width I was used to with previous pairs. I held back one star because the footbed feels thinner than it used to be... walking on a gravel path these feel more like a year old pair than brand new. Still, very happy.",4, Pepper,15.0,13.0,0,2016
Jociegi,Incredibly comfortable,"  There was a time when I might have been embarrassed to be seen wearing such a gawky shoe but having achieved the ripe old age of 66 those times are past. These shoes are very very comfortable, with great support for the entire foot. They do run a bit large so I think I could have gone down a half size. Since they are a clog, however, with the grippy bottom, I have not felt like they would slip off. A bonus that they can get soaking wet with no problem. Wish I had discovered them sooner",5, Navy,9.0,7.0,0,2015

I first saw them being worn by a chef on TV and thought they were rather unattractive but decided to try a pair anyway. Boy am I glad I did, they're super comfortable and with the fur lined ones I'm able to wear them year around. They are especially light weight and they do have arch support.

Abby Padilla,Addicted to my crocs!!,"  I love my crocs! I never thought I would buy these because I never thought I would have any use for them, but I sure was wrong. I needed a pair of shoes to just throw on an wear them around my dorm. My friend convinced me that crocs were the perfect solution. I ordered them and they came on time for a pretty reasonable price. I also got some jibbitz to accessorize them and make them unique to myself. The jibbitz also help me to know which ones are mine when distinguishing them from other pairs of crocs. I now have power ranger jibbitz and a really cool alligator jibbit that looks like it is swimming. The purchase of crocs was one of my best decisions and I get a lot of compliments on them. The other day I saw someone with hot pink ones and I think that might be my next purchase.",5, Black,7.0,5.0,0,2018

Kate,I don't care how many times i've been told how ugly these are. They are comfy!,"  The first pair I had were a knock off brand and I got these hoping they would last longer. It's been at least a year and they have. I mainly wear these around the house and the patio. I have bad knees and the cushion in these really help. They are really light weight also. Barely seems like you are wearing anything. I like wearing them while I'm cooking (careful of hot liquid, won't protect from burns) or doing dishes. Also good when you have to be on your feet a long time cleaning and vacuuming. Not good on hot days. Wear with socks if you plan to wear them all day. The grip on the sole is much better than the off brand ones. Still won't wear them on wet ground after slipping badly with my old ones. I do use them as pool shoes though. Buy them a little bigger than you would think because if they are too tight and you wear them without socks you can get blisters easily. My friends kid wears these all the time and he gets blisters because he runs in them. The off brand ones I originally bought i told myself they were for gardening. After slipping a few too many times and being freaked out by bugs crawling in the little holes and I don't use them for that anymore. I have been told many times how ugly these are and i tell the people to try mine on and see how comfy they are. They agree and then say not to wear them in public ha ha.",5, Black,10.0,8.0,0,2014

Popper,Good Item,"  Good buy. Shipped promptly. Thanks. In general (for me) most Crocs tend to be a bit small and/or snug if your feet or ankles swell at all. So personal preference I usually do size up one unless an extra wide fitting style.I am a  5 1/2 - 7 in W shoes, narrow feet but prefer wide width for bit extra room and comfort.",5, Black,7.0,5.0,0,2018

Sally Rogers,Best for plantar fasciitis,"  I like crocs for work.  I am on my feet all day.  These don't have any cushion, so they aren't going to be the most comfortable shoes ever, but after a day on my feet...they don't hurt.  I have been wearing crocks for 5 years now.  I used to have plantar faciitis, really bad....I haven't since wearing crocs.  I have tried to go to a more attractive, cushioned shoe, but within two days of wearing them....my plantar faciitis returns, not bad, because I immediately start to wear my crocks and it goes away.  So I have given up and am only going to wear these to work.",5, Black,9.0,7.0,0,2013
s,... sizing is the same as another pair that I love - there really is no problem in wearing jthem,  I rated these 'somewhat large' but the sizing is the same as another pair that I love - there really is no problem in wearing jthem.  This contrasts with other brands where  an 8M ( my regular shoe size)  was a full 1 1/2 in too small.  The strap iin back keeps them anchored with no problem (a real consideration since I'm just recovering from a broken ankle).

Marcy,Good for Short Walks (dogs/chores),"  Bought these to walk the dogs throughout the day (usually for 20 minutes). Also use them when watering plants/shrubs outside, getting mail, or throwing out trash.  More comfortable than flip-flops as they provide no arch support and you can't really walk fast in them.  Have not worn them longer than one hour.  They fit as expected b/c the description does say they run a little large.  I normally wear a 6.5 so I purchased the Women's 6 US.  You have to get used to the cushioning/padding inside.  They're textured with little plastic nubs that massage your soles as you walk. B/c I don't wear socks, when I take them off and walk on the carpet, there's a strange sensation on the soles of my feet. Not really a complaint, but I can see why it might not be ideal for all-day wear.",4, Black,6.0,4.0,0,2015

This is my first time buying Crocs because I was looking for a new type of shoe to wear around the house rather, than flip flops or western boots, so Im trying these. The sole has a bumpy texture, which im not used to, but if I can get used to that I think these will work great. The plastic on the outside seems decently solid while the inside is semi spongy & comfortable. Since im rough on my foot wear this is a bonus. Hopefully these will last a little while!",4, Chocolate,9.0,7.0,0,2014
A. Rashid,Comfortable and rather fancy.,"  This shoe is lightweight, comfortable, and very squishy. However, my dad thinks this shoe is rather fancy and too fashionable for his taste lol. He prefers the simpleness of Crocs Classic Flip-Flop or Classic Slide. Although the color looks a little different compared to the one shown in photo (the one my dad received has a greener tone to it), but it is still acceptable. Crocs shoes are divided into three types: roomy fit, relaxed fit, standard fit. This shoe has a roomy fit and it fits my dad as expected.

Adjust the swiveling back securing foot strap and you can wear it all day like any other sandal. I've tried very hard to make them slip off and I couldn't get them to slip off accidentally. Leave the swiveling back securing foot strap towards the front of the shoe and you have a quick and easy slip op show or sandal. The shoe's design is very airy. Obviously you feet will get cold on a cold day, but it's refreshing. I would buy it again, but it's unlikely that'll i'll have to buy another because the Crocs feel solidly built and durable.Note that the shoe is typically larger that average shoe sizes, but frankly it's not a big deal.

Michael Brenner,"Durable, comfortable, all-weather","  This footwear fit my needs perfectly.  I was looking for all-weather, all-terrain footgear that is quick to put on and quick to take off.  Slip-on's were a must.  I use them for walking around outside my house, which means I'm walking in dirt, grass, on cement, on a wooden deck, and so forth.  I also use them for boating on a pontoon boat and for general, quick around-town use.  These clogs fit the bill perfectly.  They are durable, don't get dirty easily, are very easy to clean, and provide the foot with protection without stifling the foot.  I'm very satisfied with this product.

Whenever we camped or stopped by a river he would switch out his shoes and socks and slip on the crocs and off he went into the stream, river, or lake with no worries of stepping on rough rocks, sticks or whatever was underneath or rocks and boulders that are above the water. I didn't have any crocs at the time so I had to walk with my bare feet if I wanted to go in. They also made great camping shoes when setting up camp and just relaxing.

Little Frog,My first pair of Crocs and I love 'em!,"  This is my first pair of Crocs and I love them!  I have a wide foot and comfort is key.  Crocs reminded me of the white ""earth shoes"" I wore back in the 70's & 80's while working in the medical field.  I remembered they weren't the most attractive shoes (looked like I had ""duck feet"") but they were comfortable.  I have friends that wear Crocs and decided to give them a try.  I usually wear an 8-1/2 or 9 and was torn between sizes.  Crocs recommends you order down to the next whole size if you are in-between sizes.  I ordered Classic Crocs / size W9 and I thought they were slightly longer than I needed so I ordered an 8 to be sure.  The length of the foot bed for the 8 was fine but I found the toe box to be a little snug on my littlest toe.  I kept the 9's and am glad I did.  I work in an office of a manufacturing plant with a casual dress code. Most of the building has concrete floors and the Crocs are just perfect for me.  I have since bought another pair in a different color and a pair of Crocs sandals.  The Classic Crocs clogs have ventilation so my feet don't get too hot like they might have in some of the closed styles.  I know Crocs have been around a long time and I don't know why it took me so long to try a pair.  I'm very happy I did.",5, Black,9.0,7.0,3,2016

Donald Shinn,Great for me!,"  I think this is my fifth or sixth pair of Crocs and they've all been great. I have two very arthritic ankles that don't like anything in the way of impacts or jarring and Crocs are basically all a pad, so they really help keep the ankles happy. The new ones always feel a little weird with the fresh nubs on the inside, but I adjust quickly. (My older Crocs have the nubs pretty much worn down.)",5, Black,11.0,9.0,0,2015
Fluffy Grandma,My Crocs,"  These are being worn by people from 1-101 and I was curious.  Well, I'm not curious anymore; I am delighted.  Crocs are light-weight, comfortable enough to wear around the house or on those extensive window-shopping outings.  They are easy to get on and off (and believe me, with arthritis, that is important).  I wear them with the strap over the top for quick slip-on/off and with the strap down when lots of walking in anticipated. Either way, they are great. And, yes, I will be buying Crocs again.",5, Chocolate,13.0,11.0,1,2008

Huntress1327,The only thing he is not so happy about is the size,  My Hubby loves these. Really cousiony and comfy. at first he thought they were a little hard but when they are warmed by your feet they get supple and more squishy.

Sparky,"Weightless, comfy, but tiny break in period","  Newbies: Wearing Crocs is not like wearing shoes. They weigh next to nothing and are cushiony without feeling spongy. Your feet don't have to 'grab' them to stay on: you walk effortlessly, even with the backstrap worn forward over your arch, like clogs. They are waterproof, so the shoes are great for gardening, and the ventilation holes will help your feet breathe; you don't have to wear socks, but I do to avoid any hint of sweaty feet. That's not a real problem for me, but feet vary.  After a short period of wearing them, they become even less noticeable as they conform to your feet. Two days later, most of you won't remember any problems, if you had them. Note: They will wear out eventually, especially if you wear them frequently on concrete. Replace them when the soles wear down, before they become dangerously slippery.Previous users: Remember that new Crocs won't fit like the old ones. The need time to adapt to your feet, particularly the backstrap, which will feel shorter at first.All: Khaki is a wonderful dust color for summer wear. Chocolate is not exactly milk chocolate or bittersweet. It's got a bit of green tinge, which makes it quite attractive for brown feet.",5, Khaki,13.0,11.0,5,2008
JThibodo,Good croc for size 14 foot - Blu is a good color!,"  Wishing crocs came in more interesting colors for large feet (size 14+). This Blue is about it. Nice deep blue that goes well with jeans. Black and brown remind me too much of the shoes I have to wear for work! Still, great around the house shoes or run to town shoes. Very useful in summer if you live in a place where it rains. Doing a lot of kitchen work? These are perfect- like standing on one of those cushion mats you lay down on hard floors.",5, Navy,16.0,14.0,0,2014

Roo99,"Fantastic for swollen, pregnant feet","  I'm 7 months pregnant, and in the summer, my feet get very swollen.  I was down to 2 pair shoes that I could wear to work (closed toes shoes) and saw these on sale.  I was looking at Crocs for sometime, but was balking at the $34 price tag.  These were on sale, so I figured I might as well.  Oh, my fat feet are happy.  Good support, and they stretch with my feet throughout the day, so no pinching.  They do seem to shrink overnight, because they don't seem overly large the next day.  Obviously not very fashionable, but I was not looking for fashion, just shoes I could wear in semi-comfort.  I usually wear a 7.5/8 women's, and ordered these in a women's 8, which are fitting well.Additionally, at the end of the day if I need to slip on shoes for whatever reason, these are the only ones which I can stuff my feet into without pain, pinching, or having to try and bend down and adjust straps.

Lewis R.,Very comfortable. Great for my intended uses to replace flip ...,"  Very comfortable. Great for my intended uses to replace flip flops and to dry my feet out after walking around in boots or being wet all day.  However, the site suggested going up half a size if you are inbetween. I generally wear a 9.5 military boot or a 10 in regular shoes. I went with a 10, and the back strap barely catches on my heel as I take a step.  Fine for walking around on dry ground, indoors, at the pool etc.  However, it's a bit too large to walk around in muck, submerged water (creeks etc) because it just isn't tight enough.  If I purchased again I would actually go down half a size.",4, Black,12.0,10.0,0,2017

He's a big guy... retired football coach.  He says he loves the way the shoes fit.  His only problem is how they look.  Says he'll wear them, but he just can't look down at them.

Ariana,From a Catholic to a Crocoholic,"  Let me start by saying one thing: I never thought I would own crocs.Here is my coming of Croc story.I always thought these shoes were so ugly. I first saw them about 8 years ago and thought ""Why would someone ever put something like that on their feet?"" and people would always say how comfortable they were. I just thought they were dumb to think wearing this shoe was okay.Well go into the futre to now, I am a graduate nurse whos feet are killing her on 12hr shifts. So I decide to give them a try.Now I am a converted crocoholic. I love these shoes, I even made my other new nurse friends buy them lolThey are honestly so comfortable on my feet, and when unsightly things spill on them, you can just wipe them off.I also love that you may or may not use the strap in the back, sometimes I like to be scandalous and let my heels out and other times I like to wear the straps around my ankles (call me bojangles).But for real, if you have never tried these before, you should. They are worth the one time try- and then you will be addicted.",5, Black,7.0,5.0,12,2017

j&a,"Comfy sandals, but gets dirty easily","  These are great casual lightweight sandals that are cushy and mold to your feet.  They are also great for wearing in/around water.  I bought a pair for myself and my hubby, who loves his as well.  Our only complaint is that these sandals get dirty easily.  We both got black, so it is always a little dusty on the outside (makes it look like dark grey), and when we wear around the yard or around town, we often get dust, pebbles, and grass in our shoes.  I suppose if you wore them where there was zero debris on the ground, they'd be the perfect shoes!  They are also easy to clean, however - just damp paper towel or cloth wipes it clean.  Fairly good traction below, too.",4, Black,8.0,6.0,1,2008

I have a bad knee that makes tying shoes very painful.  Slip-on mules and clogs are the ticket for me, and Crocs are the answer.  Whenever they go on sale, I consider buying another pair.  The only downside is that the sole tread seems to wear out to quickly in my opinion.  I like the quick and free shipping with Amazon Prime.",5, Black,11.0,9.0,0,2012
Sydney Scott,Comfy bargain,"  I've never worn Crocs before this, but I love them! They fit the shape of my foot perfectly-narrow at the heal, wide at the toes.

I wanted something I could wear around the house during the cold weather.

Stephanie C,Comfy summer work shoes,"  I work in the medical field, and normally wear danskos to work. Wanted to see if I could get something a little less hot for summer, so I gave these a try. I'm so glad I did, they are SOOO comfy! I would not wear them without socks, feel like that would end up pretty smelly after a few times wearing them like that. My favorite part of these are the ventilation holes - the AC in the car can actually cool my feet after a long day! I live in Phoenix, so that is actually a really big deal - I used to take my shoes off for the drive home to keep them from getting so hot, and you really aren't supposed to drive barefoot!

Berta Dora,As comfy as they are ugly !,"  I really like my clogs. I just don't like the way they look. And I wouldn't have considered them but I had to travel very light at some point and was jealous of a friend's clogs that served her well. The weight is amazingly low. So I tried them on and they are so comfy. First I didn't buy any because locally they are rather pricey but then I found them on amazon for a very reasonable price. I only wear them at home because I think they are really ugly but at home I wear them all the time. The are great for the garden because you can just hose them off if they get muddy. They are great for inside because they don't slip and the material warms up fast in the winter to keep my feet warm. The are treated with something antibacterial so they don't start to smell in the summer when your feet are sweaty. And they are made in Mexico which I prefer over made in China, for some reason including the short way to transport them. I like the strap in the back too. It is good if you have to walk further with them (which I usually don't but it is good to have options).",5, Chocolate,9.0,7.0,0,2013

As a nurse theses are the best shoes I have had and they don't stink after a couple of months. The  little holes allow your feet to breath and cleared up my athletes foot. But one does need shoe cover with high risk patients with excessive body fluids !  Awesome for day to day use too. Can be slippery in wet weather when old and worn out",5, Black,9.0,7.0,0,2016

Joe,* PERFECT SHOWER SHOES!,"  When I deployed to Iraq back in 2008, I bought these to use as shower shoes.  They worked very well offering a decent grip on the shower floor.  I used them for an entire year while I was deployed and they held up great.  Not just in the shower trailers, but also when  walking on the desert ground that was super hot.  After using them in Iraq, I decided to just throw them out as I wasn't about to bring them home after using everyday in public showers.  Upon my return I bought another pair that I wear to go outside or down in my basement.  I give 4 stars only because the sizing is a little off.  I am a 9.5 so I ordered size 9 which was too small.  I returned that pair, with ease might I add thanks to Amazon free return, and ordered a size 10.  The size 10 is slightly too big but not to the point where it's annoyingly coming off my foot.  The back strap does the job in keeping them on my feet.I highly recommend these Crocs.  They are a perfect shower shoe due to the almost rubberish material.  They will not deteriorate.  Also great little slip on shoes for camping as well for treks to and from the community shower house.  Enjoy!",4, Khaki,12.0,10.0,1,2016

The back strap on one of the shoes I received is too short to fit properly over the foot cover if you flip it forward rather than having it behind your heel.

Will B.,Classics are the ONLY Crocs,"  I've had 'em all and I keep returning to the Classic Crocs. Best shoe, despite any argument ANYONE has, I've ever owned. I have countless pair to the dismay of those around me... and I LOVE THEM.Since I like them so much here's some Crocs Classic info.They are great just about everywhere. I can accomplish just about every chore I do in them. They are worthless once they get water in them. (two pair and a towel nearby when gardening, really? ...hahah) So, they dry quickly.They aren't for bouldering or climbing trees but they can make it most places on a job site, trail walking, house and yard wearing.Classics are great because of the holes in the front for shaking out constant debris. Classics are affordable, but they all are relatively... these are just the best. More comfortable than the Rx pair, better than the rugged outdoor pair, night and day better than any of the fleece-lined winter ones. Get the Classics and forget the rest. ~ Cheers.",5, Navy,13.0,11.0,0,2014

Wilson Lee,Comfort needs to be engineered back into the product,"  I bought these to replace a pair I bought 18 years ago. As others have noted, the current ""Classic"" model is made with a stiffer material than the original...this is absolutely correct. I prefer the softer original, but I'm pretty sure the copycats don't make the soft ones anymore, either. These are also slightly narrower, and the raised rubber nubs feel pointier (maybe because of the stiffer rubber?). Otherwise, these are almost identical to the 18 year old model. I usually like to buy products from the innovator, even if they're more expensive than the copycats, so I may buy these again in the future. On the other hand, the most desirable features have been pretty much designed out of the product, so, when it comes time to replace these, I may go with an entirely different product.",4, Navy,11.0,9.0,2,2017

Ryan P.,Way too big.,"  I have no idea if it's just me, but I normally wear a size 12 boot, sandal, sneaker, dress shoe, slipper, you name it! But these, for a size 12, were at LEAST two sizes two big, unless you're supposed to wear them with winter socks! Maybe I don't understand the style and they're supposed to be uncomfortably huge. I exchanged for a size 11 due to the fact that amazon's selection process for these is confusing and leaves much to be desired. However, after returning these and the size 11's I had to order size 10's from eBay. The return process was simple and I got 100% back, including shipping!Otherwise very comfortable.",4, Black,14.0,12.0,0,2013

Wandering Philosopher,"Crocs around the house, with or without socks","  I love Crocs, because they're easy to slip on and off, and because they're washable. I pretty much live in them around the house. Of course, I don't know whether or not they're somehow contributing to my back pain. And I think it probably took a while for me to learn to walk in them without tripping a little now and then -- there is a little extra length in them, but I think they are supposed to fit that way.This might be the most recent pair I bought, and it's almost two years old. I don't remember whether or not it was the case with them, but over the years I remember that on at least a couple of occasions new Crocs smelled when I first received them. Can't remember exactly, but it might be sort of a fruity smell. I don't *think* it washes out, at least not in one wash, but I think it dissipates over time. I think we used to leave them to air out for a while before wearing them. My sense of smell is sometimes annoyingly sensitive, so this might not pose a problem for the average person, especially if you keep your feet away from your (and anyone else's) nose.Roomy enough to wear with socks when my feet are cold, which is another reason to prefer them over my pink fabric slides. (Those are really awkward with socks).",5, Khaki,6.0,4.0,0,2016

Professional Product Review Service,I like 'em for playing drums (and just about other general purpose use).,"  Fit great!  I used my old pair so much for practically everything that they became 'outdoor' Crocs.  I ordered this pair for my 'indoor' Crocs.A few things I really like about them, and a slightly different perspective than the norm: I love them for playing drums!  Sometimes the kick drum beater swings back and hits the top of my foot, which hurts.  The layer of plastic 'armor' that the Crocs provide eliminates that pain.  The sole isn't too grippy and the shoes are very light weight, so switching between the hi-hat and second kick pedal is easy and comfortable, too.  Great for playing drums!",5, White,11.0,9.0,5,2016

T.  Robertson,My 2nd pair,"  I liked my first pair of Crocs so much, when they wore out,  I wanted another pair.While not the most stylish shoe ever, they are super comfortable, partly due to being so lightweight.With the strap on top of the shoe, they are easy to slip into yet if you place the strap behind your foot, they stay securely on (to climb a ladder for example).Another great feature is that I can hose them off whenever I need to and they dry in no time.I normally wear a woman's size 9 1/2 shoe; in these Crocs, I wear a women's size 9/men's size 7",5, Navy,9.0,7.0,10,2014

I am on my feet all day and this shoe allows my feet to breathe and keeps them comfortable. I think they will be my everyday shoe from now on- so much safer than the rubber thongs that were my habit.

J.Allen,This is THE most comfortable shoe that you can wear for this long,"  I work in medicine and am on my feet 10-12 hours or more daily.  This is THE most comfortable shoe that you can wear for this long.  Athletic shoes have great support, but they strangle your feet and they suffocate.  These are FOAM shoes.  They are roomy and comfy and your feet breatheeeeeeeee. Other options are the Birkenstock clogs, but they are HEAVY as heck.  These are light as a feather.One thing to consider is where they are made.  I have had a few pairs of the same size and they all fit VERY VERY differently.  My previous pair was ""made in China"" and though they were size 8, they fit like a 9.  Too wide and too long.  I got used to them and used them for years.  These here IIRC are ""made in Mexico"" and they fit as a size 8 should.  At first I thought they were too small, but I was used to the ones that were too large. I read somewhere that different factories may have different molds for the same shoe.  It feels weird having ones that touch the sides of my feet, but they will break in and comform to my feet.  They are after all, foam.",5, Black,10.0,8.0,0,2015

NorCal Stu,Difficulty with Crocs' Online Sizing Tool,"  I've enjoyed Crocs for years -- tough, durable, water-proof, comfortable, even stylish. I've always purchased them in a store but ordered online just because I knew exactly what I wanted -- or thought I did until the pair I received through Amazon was a full size too big (even though the size imprinted in the shoe was identical to prior Crocs I've owned that fit well). The second (replacement) pair, sze 9M/11W, fit very well, even though I wear size 10M. As I noted upon returning the first pair, Crocs' sizing tool is not user-friendly and resulted, despite my best effort, in my having to return the first pair. Like most folks, I'm only going to re-order replacement shoes online if they are going to be VERY consistent in their size and width -- otherwise, I'll go to a store for the traditional try-on method of shopping. Since Crocs are not very expensive and available everywhere, I'm actually going to go to a store for try-ons in the future, even though Amazon's system for returns and replacing is excellent. Amazon did a great getting me the right size; my disappointment is with Crocs, who in my view make a great line of products but have a clunky and unreliable sizing system that, for me at least, made ordering online a disappointing experience.",4, Khaki,11.0,9.0,1,2016
